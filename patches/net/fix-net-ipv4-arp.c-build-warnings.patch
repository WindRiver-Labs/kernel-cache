Subject: [PATCH 1/4] fix net/ipv4/arp.c build warnings

A patch from upstream to fix
Gratuitous ARP is sometimes ignored issue,
but introduced build warnings: "warning:
comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast",
the upstream commit is 56022a8fdd874c56bb61d8c82559e43044d1aa06.
So I fixed warnings here.
