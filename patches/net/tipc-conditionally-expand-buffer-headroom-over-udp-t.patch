Subject: [PATCH 095/376] tipc: conditionally expand buffer headroom over udp
 tunnel

commit e53567948f82368247b4b1a63fcab4c76ef7d51c upstream

In commit d999297c3dbbe ("tipc: reduce locking scope during packet reception")
we altered the packet retransmission function. Since then, when
restransmitting packets, we create a clone of the original buffer
using __pskb_copy(skb, MIN_H_SIZE), where MIN_H_SIZE is the size of
the area we want to have copied, but also the smallest possible TIPC
packet size. The value of MIN_H_SIZE is 24.

Unfortunately, __pskb_copy() also has the effect that the headroom
of the cloned buffer takes the size MIN_H_SIZE. This is too small
for carrying the packet over the UDP tunnel bearer, which requires
a minimum headroom of 28 bytes. A change to just use pskb_copy()
lets the clone inherit the original headroom of 80 bytes, but also
assumes that the copied data area is of at least that size, something
that is not always the case. So that is not a viable solution.

We now fix this by adding a check for sufficient headroom in the
transmit function of udp_media.c, and expanding it when necessary.

Fixes: commit d999297c3dbbe ("tipc: reduce locking scope during packet reception")
