From b8a254517c593fd1d35ad0b69eb0f9ef7fda1837 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Greg Rose <gregory.v.rose@intel.com>
Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2013 13:45:51 +0000
Subject: [PATCH 172/232] i40e: Fix GPL header

commit dc641b7319f19a17639ed7d36aaddbf090206644 upstream

The GPL header included in each file in the i40e driver doesn't
need to include the "this program" text since this driver
is already part of the larger kernel.
