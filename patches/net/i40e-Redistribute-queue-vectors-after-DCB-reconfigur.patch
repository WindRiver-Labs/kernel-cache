Subject: [PATCH 115/594] i40e: Redistribute queue vectors after DCB
 reconfiguration

commit 0672a0918374036b7dffd9e60eeb63213e994f1b upstream.

The queue vectors are originally distributed among the total
number of queues that are configured for a given VSI. The number
of queues that are configured for a VSI depends on the number of
TCs that are enabled for the VSI at VSI setup/creation time.

But, the total number of queues that are configured for a VSI may
change based on change in the total number of TCs enabled as a
result of change in DCB configuration based on DCBX.

Hence, it is required for the queue vectors to be redistributed
when the total queues that are configured for a given VSI changes.

Without redistributing the vectors the queues that are configured
for the newly enabled TCs may not be able to do any Tx/Rx.
