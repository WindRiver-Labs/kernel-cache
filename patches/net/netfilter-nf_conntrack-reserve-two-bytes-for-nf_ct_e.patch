Subject: [PATCH 1/2] netfilter: nf_conntrack: reserve two bytes for
 nf_ct_ext->len

commit '223b02d923ecd7c84cf9780bb3686f455d279279' upstream

"len" contains sizeof(nf_ct_ext) and size of extensions. In a worst
case it can contain all extensions. Bellow you can find sizes for all
types of extensions. Their sum is definitely bigger than 256.

nf_ct_ext_types[0]->len = 24
nf_ct_ext_types[1]->len = 32
nf_ct_ext_types[2]->len = 24
nf_ct_ext_types[3]->len = 32
nf_ct_ext_types[4]->len = 152
nf_ct_ext_types[5]->len = 2
nf_ct_ext_types[6]->len = 16
nf_ct_ext_types[7]->len = 8

I have seen "len" up to 280 and my host has crashes w/o this patch.

The right way to fix this problem is reducing the size of the ecache
extension (4) and Florian is going to do this, but these changes will
be quite large to be appropriate for a stable tree.
