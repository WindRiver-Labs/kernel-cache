Subject: [PATCH 491/594] net: Add function to set the rxhash

commit 09323cc479316e046931a2c679932204b36fea6c upstream.

The function skb_set_rxash was added for drivers to call to set
the rxhash in an skb. The type of hash is also specified as
a parameter (L2, L3, L4, or unknown type).

+ * Packet hash types specify the type of hash in skb_set_hash.
+ *
+ * Hash types refer to the protocol layer addresses which are used to
+ * construct a packet's hash. The hashes are used to differentiate or identify
+ * flows of the protocol layer for the hash type. Hash types are either
+ * layer-2 (L2), layer-3 (L3), or layer-4 (L4).
+ *
+ * Properties of hashes:
+ *
+ * 1) Two packets in different flows have different hash values
+ * 2) Two packets in the same flow should have the same hash value
+ *
+ * A hash at a higher layer is considered to be more specific. A driver should
+ * set the most specific hash possible.
+ *
+ * A driver cannot indicate a more specific hash than the layer at which a hash
+ * was computed. For instance an L3 hash cannot be set as an L4 hash.
+ *
+ * A driver may indicate a hash level which is less specific than the
+ * actual layer the hash was computed on. For instance, a hash computed
+ * at L4 may be considered an L3 hash. This should only be done if the
+ * driver can't unambiguously determine that the HW computed the hash at
+ * the higher layer. Note that the "should" in the second property above
+ * permits this.
