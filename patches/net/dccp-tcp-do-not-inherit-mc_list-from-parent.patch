Subject: [PATCH] dccp/tcp: do not inherit mc_list from parent

commit 657831ffc38e30092a2d5f03d385d710eb88b09a upstream

syzkaller found a way to trigger double frees from ip_mc_drop_socket()

It turns out that leave a copy of parent mc_list at accept() time,
which is very bad.

Very similar to commit 8b485ce69876 ("tcp: do not inherit
fastopen_req from parent")

Initial report from Pray3r, completed by Andrey one.
Thanks a lot to them !
