Subject: [PATCH 2/2] sctp: not send SCTP_PEER_ADDR_CHANGE notifications with failed probe

commit 78027ced63911229092c345dbac47c385259fe35 upstream

Since the transport has always been in state SCTP_UNCONFIRMED, it
therefore wasn't active before and hasn't been used before, and it
always has been, so it is unnecessary to bug the user with a
notification.
