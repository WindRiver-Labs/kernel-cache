Subject: [PATCH 161/360] i40e: allow i40e_update_filter_state to skip
 broadcast filters

commit d88d40b01c5c0dad6a1dca3b18267849eef4a2a9 upstream.

Fix a bug where we modified the mac_filter_hash while outside a lock,
when handling addition of broadcast filters.

Normally, we add filters to firmware by batching the additions into
lists and issuing 1 update for every few filters. Broadcast filters are
handled differently, by instead setting the broadcast promiscuous mode
flags. In order to make sure the 1<->1 mapping of filters in our
addition array lined up with filters in the hlist tmp_add_list, we had
to remove the filter and move it back to the main hash. However, we
didn't do this under lock, which could cause consistency problems for
the list.

Fix this by updating i40e_update_filter_state logic so that it knows to
avoid broadcast filters. This ensures that we don't have to remove the
filter separately, and can put it back using the normal flow.
