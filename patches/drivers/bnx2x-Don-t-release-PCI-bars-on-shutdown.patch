Subject: [PATCH 116/192] bnx2x: Don't release PCI bars on shutdown

commit d9aee591b0f06bd44cd577b757d3f267bc35fe4d upstream

The bnx2x driver in its pci shutdown() callback releases its pci bars (in the
same manner it does during its pci remove() callback).
During a system reboot while VFs are enabled, its possible for the VF's remove
to be called (as a result of pci_disable_sriov()) after its shutdown callback
has already finished running; This will cause a paging request fault as the VF
tries to access the pci bar which it has previously released, crashing the
system.

This patch further differentiates the shutdown and remove callbacks, preventing the
pci release procedures from being called during shutdown.
