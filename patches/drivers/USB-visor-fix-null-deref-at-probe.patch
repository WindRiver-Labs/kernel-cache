Subject: [PATCH] USB: visor: fix null-deref at probe

commint cac9b50b0d75a1d50d6c056ff65c005f3224c8e0 upstream.

Fix null-pointer dereference at probe should a (malicious) Treo device
lack the expected endpoints.

Specifically, the Treo port-setup hack was dereferencing the bulk-in and
interrupt-in urbs without first making sure they had been allocated by
core.
