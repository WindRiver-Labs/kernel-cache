Subject: [PATCH 164/360] i40e: fix disable overflow promiscuous mode

commit a410c821c0cf50bc0b73a91435852cd04b2c7acd upstream.

There exists a bug in which the driver is unable to exit overflow
promiscuous mode after having added "too many" mac filters.  It is
expected that after triggering overflow promiscuous, removing the
failed/extra filters should then disable overflow promiscuous mode.

The bug exists because we were intentionally skipping the sync_vsi_filter
path in cases where we were removing failed filters since they shouldn't
have been added to the firmware in the first place, however we still
need to go through the sync_vsi_filter code path to determine whether or
not it is ok to exit overflow promiscuous mode.  This patch fixes the
bug by making sure we go through the sync_vsi_filter path in cases of
failed filters.
