Subject: [PATCH 1/5] backport the missing config for rtl8168

the driver from:
http://www.realtek.com.tw

since commit cec8bd9f8c59beb0a84582fc1165f1bc49b853b0
the dirver was not completely backport, missing config definition,
include :CONFIG_R8168_NAPI, CONFIG_R8168_VLAN.
without this the dirver will give a compile warning. so redo it.

+	  NAPI is a new driver API designed to reduce CPU and interrupt load
+	  when the driver is receiving lots of packets from the card.
