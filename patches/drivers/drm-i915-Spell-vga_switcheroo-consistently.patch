Subject: [PATCH 168/435] drm/i915: Spell vga_switcheroo consistently

commit '5389e916c3b64c3dd249018dfaf983e2e3a06c6f' upstream

Currently everyone and their dog has their own favourite spelling
for vga_switcheroo. This makes it hard to grep dmesg for log entries
relating to vga_switcheroo. It also makes it hard to find related
source files in the tree.

vga_switcheroo.c uses pr_fmt "vga_switcheroo". Use that everywhere.
