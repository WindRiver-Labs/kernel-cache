Subject: [PATCH 023/211] cpufreq: Add stop CPU callback to cpufreq_driver
 interface

commit 367dc4aa932bfb33a3189064d33f7890a8ec1ca8 upstream.

This callback allows the driver to do clean up before the CPU is
completely down and its state cannot be modified.  This is used
by the intel_pstate driver to reduce the requested P state prior to
the core going away.  This is required because the requested P state
of the offline core is used to select the package P state. This
effectively sets the floor package P state to the requested P state on
the offline core.
