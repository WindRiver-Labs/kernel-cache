Subject: [PATCH 134/168] watchdog: introduce watchdog_park_threads() and
 watchdog_unpark_threads()

commit 81a4beef91ba4a9e8ad6054ca9933dff7e25ff28 upstream.

Originally watchdog_nmi_enable(cpu) and watchdog_nmi_disable(cpu) were
only called in watchdog thread context.  However, the following commits
utilize these functions outside of watchdog thread context too.

      watchdog: update watchdog_thresh properly

      watchdog: Add watchdog enable/disable all functions

Hence, it is now possible that these functions execute concurrently with
the same 'cpu' argument.  This concurrency is problematic because per-cpu
'watchdog_ev' can be accessed/modified without adequate synchronization.

The patch series aims to address the above problem.  However, instead of
introducing locks to protect per-cpu 'watchdog_ev' a different approach is
taken: Invoke these functions by parking and unparking the watchdog
threads (to ensure they are always called in watchdog thread context).

  static struct smp_hotplug_thread watchdog_threads = {
           ...
          .park   = watchdog_disable, // calls watchdog_nmi_disable()
          .unpark = watchdog_enable,  // calls watchdog_nmi_enable()
  };

Both previously mentioned commits call these functions in a similar way
and thus in principle contain some duplicate code.  The patch series also
avoids this duplication by providing a commonly usable mechanism.

- Patch 1/4 introduces the watchdog_{park|unpark}_threads functions that
  park/unpark all watchdog threads specified in 'watchdog_cpumask'. They
  are intended to be called inside of kernel/watchdog.c only.

- Patch 2/4 introduces the watchdog_{suspend|resume} functions which can
  be utilized by external callers to deactivate the hard and soft lockup
  detector temporarily.

- Patch 3/4 utilizes watchdog_{park|unpark}_threads to replace some code
  that was introduced by commit 9809b18fcf6b8d8ec4d3643677345907e6b50eca.

- Patch 4/4 utilizes watchdog_{suspend|resume} to replace some code that
  was introduced by commit b3738d29323344da3017a91010530cf3a58590fc.

A few corner cases should be mentioned here for completeness.

- kthread_park() of watchdog/N could hang if cpu N is already locked up.
  However, if watchdog is enabled the lockup will be detected anyway.

- kthread_unpark() of watchdog/N could hang if cpu N got locked up after
  kthread_park(). The occurrence of this scenario should be _very_ rare
  in practice, in particular because it is not expected that temporary
  deactivation will happen frequently, and if it happens at all it is
  expected that the duration of deactivation will be short.

This patch (of 4): introduce watchdog_park_threads() and watchdog_unpark_threads()

These functions are intended to be used only from inside kernel/watchdog.c
to park/unpark all watchdog threads that are specified in
watchdog_cpumask.
