Subject: [PATCH 22/38] NVMe: Enable BUILD_BUG_ON checks

commit 21bd78bcf4208e84deab0d34f9d4e034d0580d0c upstream

Since _nvme_check_size() wasn't being called from anywhere, the compiler
was optimising it away ... along with all the link-time build failures
that would result if any of the structures were the wrong size.  Call it
from nvme_exit() for no particular reason.
