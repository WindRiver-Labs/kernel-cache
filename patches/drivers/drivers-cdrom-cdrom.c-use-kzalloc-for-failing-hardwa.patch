Subject: [PATCH] drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c: use kzalloc() for failing hardware

commit 050e4b8fb7cdd7096c987a9cd556029c622c7fe2 upstream

In drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c mmc_ioctl_cdrom_read_data() allocates a memory
area with kmalloc in line 2885.

2885         cgc->buffer = kmalloc(blocksize, GFP_KERNEL);
2886         if (cgc->buffer == NULL)
2887                 return -ENOMEM;

In line 2908 we can find the copy_to_user function:

2908         if (!ret && copy_to_user(arg, cgc->buffer, blocksize))

The cgc->buffer is never cleaned and initialized before this function.  If
ret = 0 with the previous basic block, it's possible to display some
memory bytes in kernel space from userspace.

When we read a block from the disk it normally fills the ->buffer but if
the drive is malfunctioning there is a chance that it would only be
partially filled.  The result is an leak information to userspace.
