Subject: [PATCH 026/168] ixgbe: Fix handling of NAPI budget when multiple
 queues are enabled per vector

commit 5d6002b7b822c7423e75d4651e6790bfb5642b1b upstream.

This patch corrects an issue in which the polling routine would increase
the budget for Rx to at least 1 per queue if multiple queues were present.
This would result in Rx packets being processed when the budget was 0 which
is meant to indicate that no Rx can be handled.
