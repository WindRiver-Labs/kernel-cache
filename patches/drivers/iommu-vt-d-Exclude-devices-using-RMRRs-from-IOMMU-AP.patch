Subject: [PATCH 093/108] iommu/vt-d: Exclude devices using RMRRs from IOMMU
 API domains

commit c875d2c1b8083cd627ea0463e20bf22c2d7421ee upstream.

The user of the IOMMU API domain expects to have full control of
the IOVA space for the domain.  RMRRs are fundamentally incompatible
with that idea.  We can neither map the RMRR into the IOMMU API
domain, nor can we guarantee that the device won't continue DMA with
the area described by the RMRR as part of the new domain.  Therefore
we must prevent such devices from being used by the IOMMU API.

+ * a device with associated RMRRs will never be in a "passthrough" domain.
+ * The second is use of the device through the IOMMU API.  This interface
+ * expects to have full control of the IOVA space for the device.  We cannot

+ * unencumbered IOVA space.  We also have no ability to quiesce the device's
+ * use of the RMRR space or even inform the IOMMU API user of the restriction.
+ * We therefore prevent devices associated with an RMRR from participating in
+ * the IOMMU API, which eliminates them from device assignment.
+ *
+ * In both cases we assume that PCI USB devices with RMRRs have them largely
+ * for historical reasons and that the RMRR space is not actively used post
+ * boot.  This exclusion may change if vendors begin to abuse it.
