Subject: [PATCH 71/89] hpsa: change doorbell reset delay to ten seconds

commit 00701a96f81f4e1b7279f5e05fe02274bbe29e59 upstream

After 3.22 firmware, PMC firmware guys tell us the
previous 5 second delay after a reset now needs to
be 10 secs to avoid a PCIe error due to the driver
looking at the controller too soon after the reset.
