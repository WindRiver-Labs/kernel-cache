Subject: [PATCH] floppy: Do not copy a kernel pointer to user memory in
 FDGETPRM ioctl

Backport from https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/3/7/1116

The final field of a floppy_struct is the field "name", which is a
pointer to a string in kernel memory. The kernel pointer should not be
copied to user memory. The FDGETPRM ioctl copies a floppy_struct to
user memory, including the "name" field. This pointer cannot be used
by the user, and it will leak a kernel address to user-space, which
will reveal the location of kernel code and data and undermine KASLR
protection. Instead, copy the floppy_struct except for the "name"
field.
