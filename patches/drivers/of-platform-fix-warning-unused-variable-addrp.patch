Subject: [PATCH] of/platform: fix warning "unused variable 'addrp'"

drivers/of/platform.c:81:16: warning: unused variable 'addrp' [-Wunused-variable]
  const __be32 *addrp;
                ^
  CC drivers/base/power/qos.o

The variable 'addrp' was introduced by commit 5d61b165c892(of: Allow busses
with #size-cells=0), but, later in upstream commit b8acee3ef83f(of/platform:
fix device naming for non-translatable addresses),it and related codes was
removed. However, when we introduced commit b8acee3ef83f from upstream, we
didn't remove it, that made the warning occur, so we remove it to make the code
is in accordence with upstream.
