Subject: [PATCH 068/192] bnx2x: prevent masking error from cnic

commit d9d81862671a7d139a7944090a7fe4647fc8f8d8 upstream

During error flows while loading cnic the return value was incorrectly replaced
by that of bnx2x_set_real_num_queues(); If that function was to finish
successfully then the cnic would have mistakenly thought the load ended
successfully, causing issues (& panics) later on.
