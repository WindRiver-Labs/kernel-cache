Subject: [PATCH 092/192] bnx2x: prevent CFC attention

commit ffa1cb967f650b6ce5eace09ee9b1ae7c4015d18 upstream

During VF load, prior to sending messages on HW channel to PF the VF
checks its bulletin board to see whether the PF indicated it has closed;
If a closed PF is encountered, the VF skips sending the message.

Due to incorrect return values, there's a possible scenario in which the VF
finishes loading "successfully", while the PF hasn't actually fully configured
FW/HW for the VFs supposed configuration.
Once VF tries to send Tx packets, HW will raise an attention (and FW possibly
will start treat the VF as malicious).

The patch fails the loading process in such a scenario.
