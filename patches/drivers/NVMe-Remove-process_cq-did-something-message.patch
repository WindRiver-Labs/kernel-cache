Subject: [PATCH 10/72] NVMe: Remove "process_cq did something" message

commit bc57a0f7a44cfcf3e9873f6c6b8dcecdca486b1f upstream

I was originally intending to log the fact that the kthread had done
some work since it might help us find interrupt handling problems, but
that hasn't been done yet, and spamming the logs with this message is
just rude.
