Subject: [PATCH 3/3] usbnet: cleanup after bind() in probe()

commit 1666984c8625b3db19a9abc298931d35ab7bc64b upstream

In case bind() works, but a later error forces bailing
in probe() in error cases work and a timer may be scheduled.
They must be killed. This fixes an error case related to
the double free reported in
http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg367669.html
and needs to go on top of Linus' fix to cdc-ncm.
