Subject: [PATCH 56/82] be2net: Delete secondary unicast MAC addresses during
 be_close

commit d11a347de3f521af62da25e74156ea39e3774f19 upstream

Secondary unicast MAC addresses will get deleted only when the interface is UP.
When the interface is DOWN, though these secondary MAC addresses are unusable
and awaiting to be deleted, cause the firmware to believe that they are being used.
If the user intends to set a MAC address as primary MAC from one of these
secondary MAC addresses, the firmware returns a MAC address Collision error.
Delete these secondary MAC addresses during be_close.

The secondary MAC addresses list will be refreshed during interface open anyway.
