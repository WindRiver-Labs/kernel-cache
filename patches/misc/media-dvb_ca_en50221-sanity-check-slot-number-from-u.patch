Subject: [PATCH 065/155] media: dvb_ca_en50221: sanity check slot number from
 userspace

commit a24e6348e5a0e8562ad64d760c25907ed088611c upstream.

Currently a user can pass in an unsanitized slot number which
will lead to and out of range index into ca->slot_info. Fix this
by checking that the slot number is no more than the allowed
maximum number of slots. Seems that this bug has been in the driver
forever.
