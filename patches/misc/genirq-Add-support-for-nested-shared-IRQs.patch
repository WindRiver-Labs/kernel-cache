Subject: [PATCH] genirq: Add support for nested shared IRQs

commit 45e5202213ae6541f7916bb3c64fbcd3019ec473 upstream

On a specific audio system an interrupt input of an audio CODEC is used as a
shared interrupt. That interrupt input is handled by a CODEC specific irq
chip driver and triggers a CPU interrupt via the CODEC irq output line.

The CODEC interrupt handler demultiplexes the CODEC interrupt inputs and
the interrupt handlers for these demultiplexed inputs run nested in the
context of the CODEC interrupt handler.

The demultiplexed interrupts use handle_nested_irq() as their interrupt
handler, which unfortunately has no support for shared interrupts. So the
above hardware cannot be supported.

Add shared interrupt support to handle_nested_irq() by iterating over the
interrupt action chain.
