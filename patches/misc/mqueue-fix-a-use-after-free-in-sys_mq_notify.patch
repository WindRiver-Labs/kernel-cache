Subject: [PATCH] mqueue: fix a use-after-free in sys_mq_notify()

commit f991af3daabaecff34684fd51fac80319d1baad1 upstream.

The retry logic for netlink_attachskb() inside sys_mq_notify()
is nasty and vulnerable:

1) The sock refcnt is already released when retry is needed
2) The fd is controllable by user-space because we already
   release the file refcnt

so we when retry but the fd has been just closed by user-space
during this small window, we end up calling netlink_detachskb()
on the error path which releases the sock again, later when
the user-space closes this socket a use-after-free could be
triggered.

Setting 'sock' to NULL here should be sufficient to fix it.
