Subject: [PATCH 1/2] dcache: Handle escaped paths in prepend_path

commit cde93be45a8a90d8c264c776fab63487b5038a65 upstream

A rename can result in a dentry that by walking up d_parent
will never reach it's mnt_root.  For lack of a better term
I call this an escaped path.

prepend_path is called by four different functions __d_path,
d_absolute_path, d_path, and getcwd.

__d_path only wants to see paths are connected to the root it passes
in.  So __d_path needs prepend_path to return an error.

d_absolute_path similarly wants to see paths that are connected to
some root.  Escaped paths are not connected to any mnt_root so
d_absolute_path needs prepend_path to return an error greater
than 1.  So escaped paths will be treated like paths on lazily
unmounted mounts.

getcwd needs to prepend "(unreachable)" so getcwd also needs
prepend_path to return an error.

d_path is the interesting hold out.  d_path just wants to print
something, and does not care about the weird cases.  Which raises
the question what should be printed?

Given that <escaped_path>/<anything> should result in -ENOENT I
believe it is desirable for escaped paths to be printed as empty
paths.  As there are not really any meaninful path components when
considered from the perspective of a mount tree.

So tweak prepend_path to return an empty path with an new error
code of 3 when it encounters an escaped path.
