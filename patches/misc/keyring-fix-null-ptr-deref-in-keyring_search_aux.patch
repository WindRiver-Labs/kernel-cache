Subject: [PATCH] keyring: fix null-ptr deref in keyring_search_aux

The "match" func pointer field in key_type_dead is not set and it is NULL.
If a key type request of "dead" is provoked via request_key system call, the
"match" func pointer will be dereferenced. But it is NULL, a kernel oops will
will happen.

Even though Davin declared "You shouldn't be able to deal with dead
keys at all", it should be fixed by checking the validation of the "match"
field before dereferencing in case of intentionally or unintentionally
attacking.
