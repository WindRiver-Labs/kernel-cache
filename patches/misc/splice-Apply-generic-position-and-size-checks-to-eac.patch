Subject: [PATCH] splice: Apply generic position and size checks to each write

commit 894c6350eaad7e613ae267504014a456e00a3e2a upstream(linux-stable)

We need to check the position and size of file writes against various
limits, using generic_write_check().  This was not being done for
the splice write path.  It was fixed upstream by commit 8d0207652cbe
("->splice_write() via ->write_iter()") but we can't apply that.

CVE-2014-7822

[The patch comes from linux-stable, the reason is the patch on
linux-torvalds is big and complicated(it has many dependences),
so it's not aplicable on the version.]
