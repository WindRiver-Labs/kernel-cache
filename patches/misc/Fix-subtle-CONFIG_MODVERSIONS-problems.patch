Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Fix subtle CONFIG_MODVERSIONS problems

commit cd3caefb4663e3811d37cc2afad3cce642d60061 upstream

CONFIG_MODVERSIONS has been broken for pretty much the whole 4.9 series,
and quite frankly, nobody has cared very deeply.  We absolutely know how
to fix it, and it's not _complicated_, but it's not exactly pretty
either.

This oneliner fixes it without the ugliness, and allows for further
future cleanups.

  "We've secretly replaced their regular MODVERSIONS with nothing at
   all, let's see if they notice"
