Subject: [PATCH] ktap: disable FFI support

At the time of ktap feature integration, the most recent version was
the commit "b75e8b5:Rebased on luajit and big refactor"  -- which also
notes that the FFI feature is incomplete and not yet functional.

Given that, we use the normal "BROKEN" dependency to omit the Kconfig
setting from ever getting presented to the end user.
