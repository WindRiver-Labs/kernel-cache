Subject: [PATCH] xfs: don't fail when converting shortform attr to long form
 during ATTR_REPLACE

commit 7b38460dc8e4eafba06c78f8e37099d3b34d473c upstream

Kanda Motohiro reported that expanding a tiny xattr into a large xattr
fails on XFS because we remove the tiny xattr from a shortform fork and
then try to re-add it after converting the fork to extents format having
not removed the ATTR_REPLACE flag.  This fails because the attr is no
longer present, causing a fs shutdown.

This is derived from the patch in his bug report, but we really
shouldn't ignore a nonzero retval from the remove call.
