Subject: [PATCH 222/255] pagewalk: improve vma handling

commit fafaa4264eba49fd10695c193a82760558d093f4 upstream.

Current implementation of page table walker has a fundamental problem in
vma handling, which started when we tried to handle vma(VM_HUGETLB).
Because it's done in pgd loop, considering vma boundary makes code
complicated and bug-prone.

From the users viewpoint, some user checks some vma-related condition to
determine whether the user really does page walk over the vma.

In order to solve these, this patch moves vma check outside pgd loop and
introduce a new callback ->test_walk().

 /**
- * walk_page_range - walk a memory map's page tables with a callback
- * @addr: starting address
- * @end: ending address
- * @walk: set of callbacks to invoke for each level of the tree
+ * walk_page_range - walk page table with caller specific callbacks
  *
- * Recursively walk the page table for the memory area in a VMA,
- * calling supplied callbacks. Callbacks are called in-order (first
- * PGD, first PUD, first PMD, first PTE, second PTE... second PMD,
- * etc.). If lower-level callbacks are omitted, walking depth is reduced.
+ * Recursively walk the page table tree of the process represented by @walk->mm
+ * within the virtual address range [@start, @end). During walking, we can do
+ * some caller-specific works for each entry, by setting up pmd_entry(),
+ * pte_entry(), and/or hugetlb_entry(). If you don't set up for some of these
+ * callbacks, the associated entries/pages are just ignored.
+ * The return values of these callbacks are commonly defined like below:
+ *  - 0  : succeeded to handle the current entry, and if you don't reach the
+ *         end address yet, continue to walk.
+ *  - >0 : succeeded to handle the current entry, and return to the caller
+ *         with caller specific value.
+ *  - <0 : failed to handle the current entry, and return to the caller
+ *         with error code.
  *
- * Each callback receives an entry pointer and the start and end of the
- * associated range, and a copy of the original mm_walk for access to
- * the ->private or ->mm fields.
+ * Before starting to walk page table, some callers want to check whether
+ * they really want to walk over the current vma, typically by checking
+ * its vm_flags. walk_page_test() and @walk->test_walk() are used for this
+ * purpose.
  *
- * Usually no locks are taken, but splitting transparent huge page may
- * take page table lock. And the bottom level iterator will map PTE
- * directories from highmem if necessary.
+ * struct mm_walk keeps current values of some common data like vma and pmd,
+ * which are useful for the access from callbacks. If you want to pass some
+ * caller-specific data to callbacks, @walk->private should be helpful.
  *
- * If any callback returns a non-zero value, the walk is aborted and
- * the return value is propagated back to the caller. Otherwise 0 is returned.
- *
- * walk->mm->mmap_sem must be held for at least read if walk->hugetlb_entry
- * is !NULL.
+ * Locking:
+ *   Callers of walk_page_range() and walk_page_vma() should hold
+ *   @walk->mm->mmap_sem, because these function traverse vma list and/or
+ *   access to vma's data.
