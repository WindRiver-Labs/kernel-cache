Subject: [PATCH 33/64] rcu: Move lockless_dereference() out of rcupdate.h

commit 0a04b0166929405cd833c1cc40f99e862b965ddc upstream.

I want to use lockless_dereference() from seqlock.h, which would mean
including rcupdate.h from it, however rcupdate.h already includes
seqlock.h.

Avoid this by moving lockless_dereference() into compiler.h. This is
somewhat tricky since it uses smp_read_barrier_depends() which isn't
available there, but its a CPP macro so we can get away with it.

The alternative would be moving it into asm/barrier.h, but that would
be updating each arch (I can do if people feel that is more
appropriate).
