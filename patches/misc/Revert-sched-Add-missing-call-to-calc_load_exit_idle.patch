Subject: [PATCH] Revert "sched: Add missing call to calc_load_exit_idle()"

This reverts commit 48f0f14ffb6ff4852922994d11fbda418d40100e.

It was a cherry pick of upstream commit 749c8814f08f that
somehow got incorrectly applied during the stable kernel
process.

It was meant to patch tick_nohz_restart_sched_tick() but instead
landed in tick_nohz_update_jiffies()

Revert it so we can git-am it into the proper function.
