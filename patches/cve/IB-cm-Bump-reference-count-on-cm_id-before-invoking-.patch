Subject: [PATCH 1/2] IB/cm: Bump reference count on cm_id before invoking callback

commit 29963437a48475036353b95ab142bf199adb909e upstream

When processing a SIDR REQ, the ib_cm allocates a new cm_id.  The
refcount of the cm_id is initialized to 1.  However, cm_process_work
will decrement the refcount after invoking all callbacks.  The result
is that the cm_id will end up with refcount set to 0 by the end of the
sidr req handler.

If a user tries to destroy the cm_id, the destruction will proceed,
under the incorrect assumption that no other threads are referencing
the cm_id.  This can lead to a crash when the cm callback thread tries
to access the cm_id.

This problem was noticed as part of a larger investigation with kernel
crashes in the rdma_cm when running on a real time OS.
