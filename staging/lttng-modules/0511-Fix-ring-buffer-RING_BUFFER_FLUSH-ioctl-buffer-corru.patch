Subject: [PATCH 511/933] Fix: ring buffer: RING_BUFFER_FLUSH ioctl buffer
 corruption

lib_ring_buffer_switch_slow() clearly states:

 * Note, however, that as a v_cmpxchg is used for some atomic
 * operations, this function must be called from the CPU which owns the
 * buffer for a ACTIVE flush.

But unfortunately, the RING_BUFFER_FLUSH ioctl does not follow these
important directives. Therefore, whenever the consumer daemon or session
daemon explicitly triggers a "flush" on a buffer, it can race with data
being written to the buffer, leading to corruption of the reserve/commit
counters, and therefore corruption of data in the buffer. It triggers
these warnings for overwrite mode buffers:

[65356.890016] WARNING: at
/home/compudj/git/lttng-modules/wrapper/ringbuffer/../../lib/ringbuffer/../../wrapper/ringbuffer/../../lib/ringbuffer/backend.h:110 lttng_event_write+0x118/0x140 [lttng_ring_buffer_client_mmap_overwrite]()

Which indicates that we are trying to write into a sub-buffer for which
we don't have exclusive access. It also causes the following warnings to
show up:

[65335.896208] ring buffer relay-overwrite-mmap, cpu 5: records were lost. Caused by:
[65335.896208]   [ 0 buffer full, 80910 nest buffer wrap-around, 0 event too big ]

Which is caused by corrupted commit counter.

Fix this by sending an IPI to the CPU owning the flushed buffer for
per-cpu synchronization. For global synchronization, no IPI is needed,
since we allow writes from remote CPUs.
