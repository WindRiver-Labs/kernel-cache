 The clock source currently used is the standard gettimeofday (slower,
 less scalable and less precise than the LTTng 0.x clocks).  Support for
-LTTng 0.x clocks will be added back soon into LTTng 2.0.  Please note
-that lttng-modules 2.0 can build on a Linux kernel patched with the
-LTTng 0.x patchset, but the lttng-modules 2.0 replace the lttng-modules
-0.x, so both tracers cannot be installed at the same time for a given
-kernel version.
+LTTng 0.x clocks will be added back soon into LTTng 2.0.
