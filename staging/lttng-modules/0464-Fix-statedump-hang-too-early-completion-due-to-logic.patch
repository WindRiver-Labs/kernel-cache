Subject: [PATCH 464/933] Fix: statedump hang/too early completion due to logic
 error

The previous "Fix: statedump hang due to incorrect wait/wakeup use" was
not actually fixing the real problem.

The issue is that we should pass the expected condition to wait_event()
rather than its contrary.

This bug has been sitting there for a while. I suspect that a recent
change in the Linux scheduler behavior for newly spawned worker threads
might have contributed to trigger the hang more reliably.

The effects of this bugs are:
- possible hang of the lttng-sessiond (within the kernel) at tracing
  start,
- the statedump end event is traced before all worker threads have
  actually completed, which can confuse LTTng viewer state systems.
