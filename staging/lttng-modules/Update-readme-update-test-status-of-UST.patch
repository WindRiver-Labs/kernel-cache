 Please note that the LTTng-UST 2.0 (user-space tracing counterpart of LTTng 2.0)
 is still in active development and not released yet.
 
-So far, it has been tested on vanilla kernels 2.6.38 and 2.6.39 (on x86 at the
-moment). It should work fine with newer kernels and other architectures, but
-expect build issues with kernels older than 2.6.36. The clock source currently
-used is the standard gettimeofday (slower, less scalable and less precise than
-the LTTng 0.x clocks). Support for LTTng 0.x clocks will be added back soon into
-LTTng 2.0.
