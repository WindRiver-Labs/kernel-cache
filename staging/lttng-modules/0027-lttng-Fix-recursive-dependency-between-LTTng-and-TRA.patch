Subject: [PATCH 27/27] lttng: Fix recursive dependency between LTTng and
 TRACEPOINTS

Select kvm for lttng in the commit 4c7e83487cf causes the recursive
dependency between LTTng and TRACEPOINTS, the error as follows:

kernel/trace/Kconfig:96:error: recursive dependency detected!
For a resolution refer to Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt
subsection "Kconfig recursive dependency limitations"
kernel/trace/Kconfig:96: symbol TRACING is selected by UPROBE_EVENT

drivers/staging/lttng/Kconfig:1: symbol LTTNG depends on TRACEPOINTS
For a resolution refer to Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt
subsection "Kconfig recursive dependency limitations"
init/Kconfig:1886: symbol TRACEPOINTS is selected by TRACING

For that, change "depend on TRACEPOINTS" into "select TRACEPOINTS".
