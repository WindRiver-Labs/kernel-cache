 So far, it has been tested on vanilla Linux kernels 2.6.38, 2.6.39 and 3.0-rc7
-(on x86 at the moment). It should work fine with newer kernels and other
-architectures, but expect build issues with kernels older than 2.6.36. The clock
-source currently used is the standard gettimeofday (slower, less scalable and
-less precise than the LTTng 0.x clocks). Support for LTTng 0.x clocks will be
-added back soon into LTTng 2.0. Please note that lttng-modules 2.0 can build on
-a Linux kernel patched with the LTTng 0.x patchset, but the lttng-modules 2.0
-replace the lttng-modules 0.x, so both tracers cannot be installed at the same
-time for a given kernel version.
