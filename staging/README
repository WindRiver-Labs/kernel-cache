Staging directory. Features found in this directory should not
be included directly by other features, but instead should be
found, and executed once during tree construction.

The result of features found in this tree are branches that
contain staged commits for use by other features during tree
construction.

Having staged commits allows topic branches to contain isolated
work, which is merged to BSPs, thus sharing the commit IDs and 
keeping the work independent.
