Subject: [PATCH 146/479] drm/i915: Only print information for filing bug
 reports once
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 53a4c6b26ddef1f2969f8bc17178bcda4782d18d upstream.

Repeating the same information multiple times is just annoying.
