Subject: [PATCH 0120/1077] drm/irq: Remove negative CRTC index special-case

commit 2a7d3d6d5ddbd202c09f228829cd03609a8efb23 upstream.

The drm_send_vblank_event() function treats negative CRTC indices as
meaning that a driver doesn't have proper VBLANK handling. This is the
only place where DRM needs negative CRTC indices, so in order to enable
subsequent cleanup, remove this special case and replace it by the more
obvious check for whether or not VBLANK support was initialized.
