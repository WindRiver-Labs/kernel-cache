Subject: [PATCH 0097/1077] drm/atomic-helpers: Make encoder picking more
 robust

commit 6ea76f3cade4734e73e3da842005820558b8b828 upstream.

We've had a few issues with atomic where subtle bugs in the encoder
picking logic lead to accidental self-stealing of the encoder,
resulting in a NULL connector_state->crtc in update_connector_routing
and subsequent.

Linus applied some duct-tape for an mst regression in

commit 27667f4744fc5a0f3e50910e78740bac5670d18b

    i915: temporary fix for DP MST docking station NULL pointer dereference

But that was incomplete (the code will still oops when debuggin is
enabled) and mangled the state even further. So instead WARN and bail
out as the more future-proof option.
