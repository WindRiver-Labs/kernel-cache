Subject: [PATCH 086/886] drm/i915: rip out indirection for pfit pipe_config
 assignment

commit 2deefda541edb0c73e57e988ccaac4cd014da0d3 upstream

This was still required a bit (on the cargo-cult side though) when the
state was stored in dev_priv, and when the enable/disable sequence was
botched a bit (to avoid too many updates).

But with pipeconfig we always get a clean slate, so this is pointless.
Rip it out.
