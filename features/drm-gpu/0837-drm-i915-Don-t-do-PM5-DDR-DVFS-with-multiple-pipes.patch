Subject: [PATCH 0837/1077] drm/i915: Don't do PM5/DDR DVFS with multiple pipes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 6f9c784b7ec2cc9fc9fd7c5a8634b70aadd76015 upstream.

Enabling PM5/DDR DVFS with multiple active pipes isn't a validated
configuration. It does seem to work most of the time at least, but
there is clearly an additional risk of underruns, so let's not play
with fire.
