Subject: [PATCH 0297/1369] drm/i915: Fix assert_plane warning during FDI link
 train
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 1c8562f66567807236c225d1518b0f034396f38a upstream.

assert_plane_enabled() is now triggering during FDI link train because
we no longer enable planes that early.

This problem got introduced in:
 commit a5c4d7bc187bd13bc11ac06bb4ea3a0d4001aa4d
 Author: Ville Syrj채l채 <ville.syrjala@linux.intel.com>

    drm/i915: Disable/enable planes as the first/last thing during modeset on ILK+

Just drop the assert since we shouldn't need planes for link training.
