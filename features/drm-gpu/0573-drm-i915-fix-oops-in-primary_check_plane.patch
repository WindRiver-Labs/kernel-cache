Indeed embarrassing. I've missed that we still have 1 caller left that's
using the transitional helpers, and those don't fill out
plane_state->state backpointers to the global atomic update since there is
no global atomic update for transitional helpers. Below diff should fix
this - we need to preferentially check crts_state->active and if that's
not set intel_crtc->active should yield the right result for the one
remaining caller (it's in the crtc_disable paths).

This fixes a regression introduced in
