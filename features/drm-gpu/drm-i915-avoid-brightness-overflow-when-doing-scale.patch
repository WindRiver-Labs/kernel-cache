Subject: [PATCH 874/904] drm/i915: avoid brightness overflow when doing scale

commit 22505b82a2800bddb67908522833bef96dd15845 upstream

Some card's max brightness level is pretty large, e.g. on Acer Aspire
4732Z, the max level is 989910. If user space set a large enough level
then the current scale done in intel_panel_set_backlight will cause an
integer overflow and the scaled level will be mistakenly small, leaving
user with an almost black screen. This patch fixes this problem.
