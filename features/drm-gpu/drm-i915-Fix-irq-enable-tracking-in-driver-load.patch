Subject: [PATCH 1251/1369] drm/i915: Fix irq enable tracking in driver load

commit 4868b45de11483d5b307a406d7f1a707699b1702 upstream.

A bunch of warnings fire on some ->irq_postinstall hooks since those
can enable interrupts (e.g. rps interrupts). And then our ordering
self-checks fire and complain.

To fix that set the tracking boolen before enabling the irqs with
drm_irq_install. Quoting the discussion with Jesse why that's safe:

Well we've done it in 4 commits or so, but currently we have:

- Set irqs_disabled to true early in driver load to make sure checks
that. That's done in irq_init, which is totally not the function that
enables interrupts, only the function that initializes all the vtables
and similar things. We actually have a fairly sane naming scheme
nowadays (not fully consistent ofc): _init is sw setup,
_enable/_hw_init is the actual hw setup. That is done in
95f25beddba2ec9510b249740bacc11eca70cf75

- Set irqs_disabled to false right after the irqs are actually
enabled. This is done in ed2e6df18935beb3d63613c50103bf9757b2aa85

So my change should only move the flag change over the ->preinstall
and ->postinstall hooks. I've done a little audit and didn't spot
anything amiss. Furthermore the runtime pm setup already clears
irqs_disabled _before_ calling these two hooks.

This regression has been introduced in
