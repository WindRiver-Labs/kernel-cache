Subject: [PATCH 0211/1077] drm/i915: Free batch pool when idle

commit 35c94185c56de950110a09efd5d176292a21360b upstream.

At runtime, this helps ensure that the batch pools are kept trim and
fast. Then at suspend, this releases memory that we do not need to
restore. It also ties into the oom-notifier to ensure that we recover as
much kernel memory as possible during OOM.
