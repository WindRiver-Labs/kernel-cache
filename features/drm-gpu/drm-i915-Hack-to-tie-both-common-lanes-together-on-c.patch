Subject: [PATCH 1021/1369] drm/i915: Hack to tie both common lanes together
 on chv
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 3dd7b97458e8aa2d8985b46622d226fa635071e7 upstream.

It looks like frobbing the cmnreset line on pne PHY disturbs the other
PHY on chv. The result is a black screen. On HDMI it's just a flash of
black, but DP usually falls over and can't get back up.

As a workaround set up the power domains so that both common lane
wells power up and down together. I also tried leaving the cmnreset
deasserted even the if the power well goes down but that didn't seem
acceptable to the PHY.
