Subject: [PATCH 0578/1369] drm/i915: Disable FBC by default also on Haswell
 and later

commit 0368920e51ae0cded0eb518c340a4dd17764d461 upstream.

It causes black screen on bootup and is approximately 100x slower than
running with FBC disabled, so the GPU runs at a high frequency for much
longer - completely contrary to the power saving claims. It also still
has mutex deadlocks in multi-head scenarios, which can lead to a
system/X lockup. These bugs were known before FBC was enabled by default
on Haswell and still have not been fixed.
