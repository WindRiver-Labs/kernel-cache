Subject: [PATCH 340/479] drm/i915: Prevent use-after-free of inherited
 framebuffer

commit d1a59868efa65379482c79de997973b06cefb9d2 upstream.

During KMS takeover, we try to capture the current configuration and
preserve it across our initialisation. For a variety of reasons, we may
fail this, for example if the current mode was using the legacy VGA
plane. Under such circumstances, we discard the fb in the plane config
and tried to find a matching fb on another CRTC. This obviously also
failed, leaving the plane config fb dangling, pointing to the freed block.
