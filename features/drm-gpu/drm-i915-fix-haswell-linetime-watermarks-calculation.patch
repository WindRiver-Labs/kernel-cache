Subject: [PATCH 159/904] drm/i915: fix haswell linetime watermarks calculation
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit eaa591ec528ad75bb4c77606c5cb671f05e04db6 upstream

Move the "*8"  calculation to the left side so we don't propagate
rounding errors. Also use DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST because that's what the
spec says we need to do.
