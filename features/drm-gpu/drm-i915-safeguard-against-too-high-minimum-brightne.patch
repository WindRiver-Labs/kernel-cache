Subject: [PATCH 1356/1369] drm/i915: safeguard against too high minimum
 brightness

commit e1c412e75754ab7b7002f3e18a2652d999c40d4b upstream.

Never trust (your interpretation of) the VBT. Regression from

commit 6dda730e55f412a6dfb181cae6784822ba463847

    drm/i915: respect the VBT minimum backlight brightness

causing div by zero if VBT minimum brightness equals maximum brightness.

Despite my attempts I've failed in my detective work to figure out what
the root cause is. This is not the real fix, but we have to do
something.
