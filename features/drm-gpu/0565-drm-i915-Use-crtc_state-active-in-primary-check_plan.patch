Subject: [PATCH 0565/1077] drm/i915: Use crtc_state->active in primary
 check_plane func

commit dec4f799d0a4c9edae20512fa60b0a36f3299ca2 upstream.

Since

commit 8c7b5ccb729870e606321b3703e2c2e698c49a95

    drm/i915: Use atomic helpers for computing changed flags

we compute the plane state for a modeset before actually committing
any changes, which means crtc->active won't be correct yet. Looking at
future work in the modeset conversion targetting 4.3 the only places
where crtc_state->active isn't accurate is when disabling other CRTCs
than the one the modeset is for (when stealing connectors). Which
isn't the case here. And that's also confirmed by an audit, we do
unconditionally update crtc_state->active for the current pipe.

We also don't need to update any other plane check functions since we
only ever add the primary state to the modeset update right now.
