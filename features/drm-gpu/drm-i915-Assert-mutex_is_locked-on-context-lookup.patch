Subject: [PATCH 107/904] drm/i915: Assert mutex_is_locked on context lookup

commit 186507e9e8e89d5920305fdffd8cbba6366da795 upstream

Because our context refcounting doesn't grab a ref at lookup time, it is
unsafe to do so without the lock.

NOTE: We don't have an easy way to put the assertion in the lookup
function which is where this really belongs. Context switching is good
enough because it actually asserts even more correctness by protecting
the default_context.
