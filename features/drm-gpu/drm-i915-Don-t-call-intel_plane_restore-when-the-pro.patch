Subject: [PATCH 1214/1369] drm/i915: Don't call intel_plane_restore() when
 the prop value didn't change
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

commit 09dba00c0091984626b48e1e2439f25e437c03ae upstream.

No point in calling intel_plane_restore() in .set_property() if the
value didn't change.

More importantly this papers over a bug where the current primary plane
code forgets to update the user coordinates we store under intel_plane
unless the primary plane .update_plane() hook is actually called. This
means we have 0 in the coordinates straight after boot and any call
to intel_restore_plane() (such as from restore_fbdev_mode()) will
actually turn off the primary plane. This mess needs to be fixed properly
but that's a bigger task and the first step there is killing off
intel_pipe_set_base() and just calling the primary plane
.update_plane() hook. For the immediate problem of black screen after
boot this small patch is enough to hide it.

The problem originates from these two commits:
