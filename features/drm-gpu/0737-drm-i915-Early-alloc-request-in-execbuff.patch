Subject: [PATCH 0737/1077] drm/i915: Early alloc request in execbuff

commit 0c8dac889539ab26382ba1636ec1159cae73f2b3 upstream.

Start of explicit request management in the execbuffer code path. This patch
adds a call to allocate a request structure before all the actual hardware work
is done. Thus guaranteeing that all that work is tagged by a known request. At
present, nothing further is done with the request, the rest comes later in the
series.

The only noticable change is that failure to get a request (e.g. due to lack of
memory) will be caught earlier in the sequence. It now occurs right at the start
before any un-undoable work has been done.

v2: Simplified the error handling path.
