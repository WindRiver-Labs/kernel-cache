Subject: [PATCH 046/452] mtd: spi-nor: add more read transfer flags for
 n25q256a

The NOR flash can supports dual/quad/ddr-quad read.
Add more flags for these read transfers.

From the datasheet, the chip support the 64K sector erase operation.
So remove the SECT_4K for the chip which makes the flash_erase faster.
