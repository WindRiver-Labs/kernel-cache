Subject: [PATCH 146/452] dpaa2-eth: Fix "NOHZ: local_softirq_pending" warning

Explicitly run softirqs after we enable NAPI. This in particular gets us
rid of the "NOHZ: local_softirq_pending" warnings, but it also solves a
couple of other problems, among which fluctuating performance and high
ping latencies.

Notes:
 - This will prevent us from timely processing notifications and
other "non-frame events" coming into the software portal. So far,
though, we only expect Dequeue Available Notifications, so this patch
is good enough for now.
 - A degradation in console responsiveness is expected, especially in
cases where the bottom-half runs on the same CPU as the console.
