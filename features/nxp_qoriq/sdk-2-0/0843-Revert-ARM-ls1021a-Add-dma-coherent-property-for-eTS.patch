Subject: [PATCH 843/845] Revert "ARM: ls1021a: Add dma-coherent property for
 eTSEC nodes"

This reverts commit 70b5ea97281fb9ee1ed17c9b9c866a6604b843df.
The Rev1 IOT board does not support dma coherenct, here disable it.
For Rev2 IOT board, the dma coherenct would be implemented in commit
"arm: ls1021a: add platform notifier for dma-coherent requirement".
