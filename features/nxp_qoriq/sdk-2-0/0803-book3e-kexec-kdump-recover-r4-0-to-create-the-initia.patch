Subject: [PATCH 803/838] book3e/kexec/kdump: recover "r4 = 0" to create the
 initial TLB

From http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/257660/

In commit 96f013f, "powerpc/kexec: Add kexec "hold" support for Book3e
processors", requires that GPR4 survive the "hold" process, for IBM Blue
Gene/Q with with some very strange firmware. But for FSL Book3E, r4 = 1
to indicate that the initial TLB entry for this core already exists so
we still should set r4 with 0 to create that initial TLB.
