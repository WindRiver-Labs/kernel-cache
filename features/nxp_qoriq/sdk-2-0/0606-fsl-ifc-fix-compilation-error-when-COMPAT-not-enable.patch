Subject: [PATCH 606/752] fsl-ifc: fix compilation error when COMPAT not
 enabled

When CONFIG_COMPAT is not enabled for cases when 64K pages
are enabled, there are a series of include dependencies that
result in some definitions in sched.h that get missed (e.g.
 TASK_NORMAL).  Explictly include sched.h to resolve this.
(This seems to be what other drivers do as well)
