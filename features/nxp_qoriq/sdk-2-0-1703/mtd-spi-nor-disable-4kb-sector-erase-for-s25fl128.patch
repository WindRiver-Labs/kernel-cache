Subject: [PATCH 140/508] mtd: spi-nor: disable 4kb sector erase for s25fl128

As for s25fl128s flash, the sectors are organized either as a hybrid
combination of 4-kB and 64-kB sectors, or as uniform 256-kbyte sectors.
we should use the command 0xd8 to erase all bits, not the Parameter 4-kB
Sector Erase (P4E) command 0x20.
