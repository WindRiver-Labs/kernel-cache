Subject: [PATCH 221/508] dpa_offload/dpa_stats: Fix bad propagation of
 counters offsets to US during sync get_counters

The user space driver expects some updates in the counters Ids array.
It expects to see there, for the user space counters, the exact offsets
where it needs to fill in the statistics data. This data was propagated
in case of async calls to dpa_stats_get_counters, but NOT in case of
synchronous calls.
