Subject: [PATCH 470/508] crypto: caam/qi - fix we_mask bits for response FQ
 init command
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The "Write Enable" bitmask contains a spurios QMAN_INITFQ_FLAG_LOCAL
flag.
Its value - being identical to QM_INITFQ_WE_TDTHRESH - enables updating
the Tail Drop fields in the FQD.
Even though the flag is benign - since FQD[FQ_CTRL[Tail_Drop_Enable]]
isn't set - it's useless and thus removed.

Note: even if the intention was to set QMAN_INITFQ_FLAG_LOCAL flag as
part of "flags" used in qman_init_fq(..., flags, ...), currently
it isn't needed, since destination channel and WQ are set in caam/qi
driver.
