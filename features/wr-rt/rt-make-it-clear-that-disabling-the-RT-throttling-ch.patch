Subject: [PATCH] rt: make it clear that disabling the RT throttling check is
 not good

People think that disabling the RT throttling check, and clearing
off the normally 5% reserved non-RT task slice is perfectly OK.
But then they wonder why RCU or ksoftirqd never runs on that core.
Lets make it perfectly clear that if you disable the safety feature
then you better be darn sure you have your tuning right.
