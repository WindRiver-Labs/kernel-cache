Subject: [PATCH] driver: video: fix 2 build warnings
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

in file cvbs.c, there is a mutex variable(cvbs_setting_mutex) defined
but not used.
In file vce_drv.c, there is a mutex variable(vce_reset_mutex) defined
but not used.
So, there will be 2 build warnings.
The 2 build warnings are all introduced by commit 91ad4ed00ed4
(“video: add owl video drivers”) when merge SDK patch related with
video driver.
Therefore, delete unused mutex variable to fix build warning.
