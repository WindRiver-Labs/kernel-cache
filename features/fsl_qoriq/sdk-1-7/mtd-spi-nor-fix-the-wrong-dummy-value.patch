Subject: [PATCH 359/399] mtd: spi-nor: fix the wrong dummy value

commit 0b78a2cf2a73b5f32ffda8cde7866ca61ce0e0b7 upstream

For the DDR Quad read, the dummy cycles maybe 3 or 6 which is less then 8.
The dummy cycles is actually 8 for SPI fast/dual/quad read.

This patch makes preparations for the DDR quad read, it fixes the wrong dummy
value for both the spi-nor.c and m25p80.c.
