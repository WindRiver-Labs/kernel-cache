From f0370fb6f3969c8486334eca219c8858c31fde4c Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Andy Fleming <afleming@freescale.com>
Date: Fri, 29 Mar 2013 19:19:32 -0500
Subject: [PATCH 0050/1383] qoriq: Add dpaa device trees

This is a giant patch which adds *all* the dpaa device trees. They
have been compile-tested, but not boot-tested, as most of the
drivers are not yet moved forward.

Signed-off-by: Andy Fleming <afleming@freescale.com>
[Original patch taken from QorIQ-SDK-V2.0-20160527-yocto]
Signed-off-by: Yanjiang Jin <yanjiang.jin@windriver.com>
