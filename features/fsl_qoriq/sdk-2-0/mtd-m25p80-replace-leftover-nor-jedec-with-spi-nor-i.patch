Subject: [PATCH 0223/1429] mtd: m25p80: replace leftover "nor-jedec" with
 "spi-nor" in comments

commit c1711b297f6e2270c1cb17de512985ef500e0de9 upstream

I overlooked a few comments in commit 8947e396a829 ("Documentation: dt:
mtd: replace "nor-jedec" binding with "jedec, spi-nor""). Fix these up
now.
