Subject: [PATCH 0614/1429] doc: dt: mtd: stop referring to driver code for
 spi-nor IDs

commit 1d158315c13b6989f7ddb1d8d334965d14d958d8 upstream

Pull the supported chip names from drivers/mtd/devices/m25p80.c and stop
pointing readers to Linux code.

Also (although I see this habit repeated throughout the
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/ tree), stop using the title "driver"
in this file, when we're trying explicitly to describe hardware, not
software.
