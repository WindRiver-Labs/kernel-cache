+/* These stubs are required to alloc qbman drivers to determine what ranges of
+ * resources are available for dynamic allocation, primarily because there are
+ * some legacy "a priori" assumptions in certain subsystems (eg. networking)
+ * that certain resources are reserved for their use. When those drivers (and in
+ * some cases, their corresponding device-tree nodes) are updated to dynamically
+ * allocate their resources, then *all* resources can be managed by the
+ * allocators and there may be no further need to define these stubs.
+ *
+ * A couple of qualifiers to the above statement though:
+ *
+ * - Some resource ranges are hardware-specific, rather than being defined by
+ *   software memory allocation choices. Eg. the number of available BPIDs is
+ *   baked into silicon and so will probably always need to be expressed in the
+ *   device-tree, though in that case it will express all BPIDs, not just those
+ *   available for dynamic allocation.
+ *
+ * - Even for memory-backed resources that are software determined (FQIDs), this
+ *   information may only be configured and available on the control-plane
+ *   partition that manages the device, so in AMP or hypervised scenarios there
+ *   may still be need to a way to provide allocation ranges. Ie. for O/S
+ *   instances that don't know how many resources are available to hardware, and
+ *   possibly even for O/S instances that do know how many are available but
+ *   that should not "own" all of them.

+/* These stubs are required to alloc qbman drivers to determine what ranges of
+ * resources are available for dynamic allocation, primarily because there are
+ * some legacy "a priori" assumptions in certain subsystems (eg. networking)
+ * that certain resources are reserved for their use. When those drivers (and in
+ * some cases, their corresponding device-tree nodes) are updated to dynamically
+ * allocate their resources, then *all* resources can be managed by the
+ * allocators and there may be no further need to define these stubs.
+ *
+ * A couple of qualifiers to the above statement though:
+ *
+ * - Some resource ranges are hardware-specific, rather than being defined by
+ *   software memory allocation choices. Eg. the number of available BPIDs is
+ *   baked into silicon and so will probably always need to be expressed in the
+ *   device-tree, though in that case it will express all BPIDs, not just those
+ *   available for dynamic allocation.
+ *
+ * - Even for memory-backed resources that are software determined (FQIDs), this
+ *   information may only be configured and available on the control-plane
+ *   partition that manages the device, so in AMP or hypervised scenarios there
+ *   may still be need to a way to provide allocation ranges. Ie. for O/S
+ *   instances that don't know how many resources are available to hardware, and
+ *   possibly even for O/S instances that do know how many are available but
+ *   that should not "own" all of them.
