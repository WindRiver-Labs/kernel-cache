Subject: [PATCH 0380/1429] crypto: caam - fix writing to JQCR_MS when using
 service interface

commit 9f587fa29f7e8ed6b8885cff51a51ace3ad85152 upstream

Most significant part of JQCR (Job Queue Control Register) contains
bits that control endianness: ILE - Immediate Little Endian,
DWS - Double Word Swap.
The bits are automatically set by the Job Queue Controller HW.

Unfortunately these bits are cleared in SW when submitting descriptors
via the register-based service interface.
>From LS1021A:
JQCR_MS = 08080100 - before writing: ILE | DWS | SRC (JR0)
JQCR_MS = 30000100 - after writing: WHL | FOUR | SRC (JR0)

This would cause problems on little endian caam for descriptors
containing immediata data or double-word pointers.
Currently there is no problem since the only descriptors ran through
this interface are the ones that (un)instantiate RNG.
