Subject: [PATCH 1120/1207] powerpc:/fsl-booke-32: fix tlb_lock build break

[Original patch taken from QorIQ-SDK-V1.6-SOURCE-20140619-yocto.iso]

tlb_lock and tlb_unlock were defined for 64-bit fsl booke, but one of the functions it was
used in is shared with 32-bit, so we need no-op stubs for 32-bit.
