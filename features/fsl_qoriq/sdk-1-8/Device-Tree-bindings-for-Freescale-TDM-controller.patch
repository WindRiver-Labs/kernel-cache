+TDM Device Tree Binding
+Copyright (C) 2012 Freescale Semiconductor Inc.
+
+NOTE: The bindings described in this document are preliminary
+and subject to change.
+
+=====================================================================
+TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)
+
+DESCRIPTION
+
+The TDM is full duplex serial port designed to allow various devices including
+digital signal processors (DSPs) to communicate with a variety of serial devices
+including industry standard framers, codecs, other DSPs and microprocessors.
+
+The below properties describe the device tree bindings for Freescale TDM
+controller.
+This TDM controller is available on various Freescale Processors like
+MPC8313, P1020, P1022 and P1010.
+
+PROPERTIES
+
+  - compatible
+      Usage: required
+      Value type: <string>
+      Definition: Should contain "fsl,tdm1.0".
+
+  - reg
+      Usage: required
+      Definition: A standard property. The first reg specifier describes the
+          TDM registers, and the second describes the TDM DMAC registers.
+
+  - clock-frequency
+      Usage: optional
+      Value type: <u32 or u64>
+      Definition: The frequency at which the TDM block is operating.
+
+  - interrupts
+      Usage: required
+      Definition: Definition: Two interrupt specifiers.  The first is TDM
+          error, and the second is TDM EMAC.
+
+  - phy-handle
+      Usage: optional
+      Value type: <phandle>
+      Definition: Phandle of the line controller node or framer node eg. SLIC,
+          E1/T1 etc.
+
+  - fsl,max-time-slots
+      Usage: required
+      Value type: <u32>
+      Definition: Maximum number of 8-bit time slots in one TDM frame.
+          This is the maximum number which TDM hardware supports.
+
+EXAMPLE
+
+	tdm@16000 {
+		compatible = "fsl,tdm1.0";
+		reg = <0x16000 0x200 0x2c000 0x2000>;
+		clock-frequency = <0>;
+		interrupts = <16 8 62 8>;
+		phy-handle = <&zarlink1>;
+		fsl,max-time-slots = <128>;
+	};
