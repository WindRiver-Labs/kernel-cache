Subject: [PATCH 279/987] dpaa_eth: Set a fixed upper limit for recycleable
 buffer size

[Original patch taken from QorIQ-SDK-V1.6-SOURCE-20140619-yocto.iso]

Until now we considered a buffer recycleable if its size didn't
exceed the buffer pool size by more than a certain amount.

Recent changes in the stack however allow the allocation of skb
buffers much larger than the requested size, which impacts our
ability to recycle forwarded frames, especially when jumbo frame
support is enabled.

Make the recycling size upper limit a fixed and sufficiently large
value, regardless of the default size of the buffer pool, in order
to simplify recycling logic and guard against unfavourable cases.
