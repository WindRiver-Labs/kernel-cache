Subject: [PATCH 1114/1114] dts/t208xqds:drop the interrupts property of rtc
 device node

According to board's readme, the RTC INT pin is route to external
IRQ 11 by on board FPGA. However, there is no instruction about how to
set FPGA register to enable this IRQ. Neither external IRQ 11 nor IRQ 1
can be used as RTC INT line. Just drop the interrupts property
of rtc node to disable DS3232 interrupt.
