Subject: [PATCH 01/57] ppc: DTS: remove all t104* DTS files.

There are too many differences between SDK1.8 and current base in t104*
DTS files as shown below, remove all t104* DTS files now.
Will port all relative patches one by one based on SDK1.8 later.

Main differences between SDK1.8 and current base:
1. Missed files: t1040d4rdb.dts, t1040rdb-dsar.dts,
   t1040rdb-usdpaa-shared-interfaces.dts, t1040rdb-usdpaa.dts,
   t1042d4rdb.dts misses, t1042rdb_pi-dsar.dts t104xd4rdb.dtsi.
2. t1040qds.dts misses "soc" and "qe" definitions;
3. t1040rdb.dts: misses "ifc", "soc", "qe" and "pci" definitions;
4. t1042qds.dts: misses and "qe" definitions;
5. t1042rdb.dts: misses "ifc", "soc", "qe" and "pci" definitions;
6. t1042rdb_pi.dts: misses "ifc", "soc", "qe" and "pci" definitions;
7. t104xqds.dtsi: misses "dpaa" definition.
8. fsl/t1040si-post.dtsi: misses "qportals", "qe", "fman" definitions;
9. fsl/t104xsi-pre.dtsi: misses "pme", "qbfman", "ethernet" definitions.
