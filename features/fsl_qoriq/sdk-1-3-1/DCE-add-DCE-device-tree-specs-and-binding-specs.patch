+DCE Device Tree Binding
+Copyright (C) 2012 Freescale Semiconductor Inc.
+
+ CONTENTS
+   -Overview
+   -DCE Node and Example
+
+NOTE: the DCE is also known as Freescale's Decompression and Compression Engine
+
+=====================================================================
+Overview
+
+DESCRIPTION
+
+    The Decompression and Compression Engine is an accelerator compatible
+    with Datapath Architecture providing lossless data decompression and
+    compression for the QorIQ family of SoCs.
+
+=====================================================================
+DCE Node
+
+Description
+
+    Node defines the base address of the DCE block.
+    This block specifies the address range of all global
+    configuration registers for the DCE block.  It
+    also receives error interrupts
+
+
+PROPERTIES
+
+   - compatible
+      Usage: required
+      Value type: <string>
+      Definition: Must include "fsl,dce"
+
+   - reg
+      Usage: required
+      Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
+      Definition: A standard property.  Specifies the physical
+          address and length of the DCE configuration registers.
+          registers
+
+   - interrupts
+      Usage: required
+      Value type: <prop_encoded-array>
+      Definition:  Specifies the interrupts generated by this
+           device.  The value of the interrupts property
+           consists of one interrupt specifier. The format
+           of the specifier is defined by the binding document
+           describing the node's interrupt parent.
+           This device only generates an error interrupt.
+
+   Note: All other standard properties (see the ePAPR) are allowed
+   but are optional.
+
+
+EXAMPLE
+	dce@312000 {
+		compatible = "fsl,dce";
+		reg = <0x312000 0x10000>;
+		interrupts = <16 2 1 4>;
+	};
