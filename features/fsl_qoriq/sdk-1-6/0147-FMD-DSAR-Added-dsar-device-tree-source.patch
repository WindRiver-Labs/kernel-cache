+  - ar-tables-sizes
+      Usage: optional
+      Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
+      Definition: Specifies the max number of entries which would be allocated
+        to each protocol in the auto response module. 0 value means protocol is
+        not supported. This field is only relevant for Rx ports.
+        A special value is the SNMP_char which stands for total
+        number of characters that would be available for the SNMP protocol in
+        auto response; Since all memory for the auto response must be pre
+        allocated, this is the only value that can't be auto calculated from
+        number of entries.
+        For example, if SNMP table uses among other values 3 strings:
+        "General printer", "idle", "Floor 2",
+        then the number of characters used is 15+4+7=26. The SNMP_char should
+        be a maximal value for such cases, i.e. worst case for such combination.
+        the location of the protocols is as followes:
+        < ARP ICMPv4 NDP ICMPv6 SNMP_ipv4 SNMP_ipv6 SNMP_oid SNMP_char >
+
+  - ar-filters-sizes
+      Usage: optional
+      Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
+      Definition: Specifies the max number of entries which would be allocated
+        to each filtering table in the auto response module.
+        0 value means such filtering table will not be used.
+        This field is only relevant for Rx ports.
+        the location of the filtering tables is as followes:
+        < IP_prot TCP_port UDP_port >
