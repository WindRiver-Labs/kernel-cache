Subject: [PATCH 254/466] powerpc: book3e: _PAGE_LENDIAN must be _PAGE_ENDIAN

commit c199efa295fc99c029bcbd88ed4ded3334493e95 upstream

For booke3e _PAGE_ENDIAN is not defined. Infact what is defined
is "_PAGE_LENDIAN" which is wrong and that should be _PAGE_ENDIAN.
There are no compilation errors as
arch/powerpc/include/asm/pte-common.h defines _PAGE_ENDIAN to 0
as it is not defined anywhere.
