Subject: [PATCH 0501/1089] dpa_offload: Reduce the size of the IPv4 header
 options field

[Original patch taken from QorIQ-SDK-V1.6-SOURCE-20140619-yocto.iso]

According to RFC 791, the size of the IPv4 header (options
included) is represented on 4 bits (IHL), hence it can be an
absolute maximum of 15 * 4 = 60 bytes. The IPv4 options buffer
size field in the fsl_dpa_offload.h header file, in the
ipv4_header data structure, was declared as an "unsigned int" and
this was causing a static analysis warning in dpa_classifier.

The field was reduced to uint8_t which is more than enough to
store the size of the IPv4 frame options.
