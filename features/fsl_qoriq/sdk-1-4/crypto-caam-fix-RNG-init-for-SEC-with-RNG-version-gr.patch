Subject: [PATCH 178/430] crypto: caam - fix RNG init for SEC with RNG version
 greater than 4

For SEC including a RNG block with a version greater than 4,
special initialization must occur before any descriptor can be
submitted. Not only SEC with a version greater than 5.0 need
this, but also any SEC that has RNG block version ID greater
or equal to 4.

Example platforms: BSC 9131/9132 have SEC v4.4 but RNG 4
