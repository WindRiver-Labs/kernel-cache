Subject: [PATCH 145/547] powerpc/booke64: add sync after writing PTE

The ISA says that a sync is needed to order a PTE write with a
subsequent hardware tablewalk lookup.  On e6500, without this sync
we've been observed to die with a DSI due to a PTE write not being seen
by a subsequent access, even when everything happens on the same
CPU.
