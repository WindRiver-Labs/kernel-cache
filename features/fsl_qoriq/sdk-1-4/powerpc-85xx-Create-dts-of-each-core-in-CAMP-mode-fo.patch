Subject: [PATCH 348/430] powerpc/85xx: Create dts of each core in CAMP mode
 for P1021RDB-PC

Create the dts files for each core and splits the devices between
the two cores for P1021RDB-PC.

Core0 has l2, serial0, i2c, spi, gpio, tdm,dma, usb, eth0, eth1,
sdhc, crypto, global-util, message, pci0, pci1, msi, crypto.
Core1 has l2, serial1, eth2.
