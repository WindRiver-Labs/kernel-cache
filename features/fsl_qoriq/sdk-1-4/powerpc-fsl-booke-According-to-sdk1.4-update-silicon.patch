Subject: [PATCH 352/430] powerpc/fsl-booke: According to sdk1.4 update
 silicon device tree for T4240

Since silicon device tree of t4240 already was introduced by sdk 1.3.1,
so the patch modify some differences between sdk 1.3.1 and sdk 1.4

The original patch is from sdk 1.4.
[
powerpc/fsl-booke: Add initial silicon device tree for T4240

Enable a baseline T4240 SoC to boot.  There are several things missing
from the device trees for T4240:

* Proper PAMU topology information
* DPAA related nodes (Qman, Bman, Fman, Rman, DCE)
* Prefetch Manager
* Thermal monitor unit
* Interlaken
