Subject: [PATCH 378/430] powerpc/85xx: Rework P5020DS device tree

commit 03f4201bd44e7d3ca7dc26b30d4251a07c77e9f2 upstream

[
Utilize new split between board & SoC, and new SoC device trees split
into pre & post utilizing 'template' includes for SoC IP blocks.

Other changes include:
* Adding of MPIC timer blocks
* Dropping "fsl,p5020-IP..." from compatibles for
* standard blocks
* Removed mpic interrupt-parent from dcsr-epu node,
* just use top level
* Removed mpic interrupt-parent from sec nodes,
* just use top level

In order to port to our dts, we only need to pick the part of the
upstream patch.
