Subject: [PATCH 371/430] powerpc/85xx: bsc9131 - Correct typo in SDHC device
 node

commit 1c374741d03ff753c2e9bf15325e0fe0b3905ead upstream

BSC9131RDB doesn't have SDHC enabled. As a result of this typo,
the node was not getting disabled from the device tree which was
leading to linux hang during bootup
