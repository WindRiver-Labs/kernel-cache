Subject: [PATCH 107/388] armv8: aarch32: Allow RAM to be mapped for LayerScape
 SoC

This patch is based on Kernel v4.1.8. As in v4.1.8, memremap() is not
introduced and the WARN() check is not relaxed to allow MT_MEMORY_RW
mappings of pfn_valid() pages, this patch is needed as a workaround for
spin-table address which locates in RAM to be mapped.

For the latest kernel in upstream, this patch is not needed anymore.
