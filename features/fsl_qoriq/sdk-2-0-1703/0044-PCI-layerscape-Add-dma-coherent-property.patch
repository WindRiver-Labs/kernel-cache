Subject: [PATCH 044/388] PCI: layerscape: Add 'dma-coherent' property

Add 'dma-coherent' description for PCI nodes.

The 'dma-coherent' indicates that the hardware IP block can ensure
the coherency of the data transferred from/to the IP block. This
can avoid the software cache flush/invalid actions, and improve
the performance significantly.

The PCI IP block of ls1043a has this capability, so adding
this feature to improve the PCI performance.
