Subject: [PATCH 113/383] qbman: Clarify post-condition for bman_acquire()

If bman_acquire() cannot provide the requested number of buffers, it
doesn't touch the bpool, even if that may still contain some, fewer,
buffers. -ENOMEM is returned, but the @bufs array is overwritten
nevertheless.

Make it clear that the caller should not rely on @bufs if this was the
case.
