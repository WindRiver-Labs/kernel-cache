Subject: [PATCH] ftrace: remove condition from ftrace_record_ip

Impact: let module functions be recorded when dyn ftrace not enabled

When dynamic ftrace had a daemon and a hash to record the locations
of mcount callers at run time, the recording needed to stop when
ftrace was disabled. But now that the recording is done at compile time
and the ftrace_record_ip is only called at boot up and when a module
is loaded, we no longer need to check if ftrace_enabled is set.
In fact, this breaks module load if it is not set because we skip
over module functions.
