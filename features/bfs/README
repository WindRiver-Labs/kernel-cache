Currently, BFS is only supported on the standard kernel with the following
BSPs: common_pc, common_pc_64, cav_octeon_cn58xx,arm_versatile_926ejs,
fsl_8572ds. BFS patches are not included by default in the wrlinux kernel.
In order to build BFS add "--with-kernel=standard+features/bfs" to your 
configure line.

There is a detailed document in linux/Documentation/scheduler, which name is
sched-BFS.txt, that is a good start to know what is BFS.
