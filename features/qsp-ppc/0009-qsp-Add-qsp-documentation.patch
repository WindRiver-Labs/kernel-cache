+Simics QSP
+==========
+
+The QSP boards are pure virtual boards for the Wind River Simics (tm) system
+simulator. They serve as demonstration/example boards. The intention is to 
+keep the Linux port as simple and elegant as possible, while maintaining code 
+reuse across all major architectures.
+
+The devices on these boards are designed for simplicity first and perfomance 
+second.
