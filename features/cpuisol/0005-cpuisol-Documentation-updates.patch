+
+Introduction
+------------
+
+The primary idea behind CPU isolation is the ability to use some CPU cores
+as a dedicated engines for running user-space code with minimal kernel
+overhead/intervention, think of it as an SPE in the Cell processor. For
+example CPU isolation allows for running CPU intensive(100%) RT task
+on one of the processors without adversely affecting or being affected
+by the other system activities.  With the current (as of early 2008)
+multi-core CPU trend we may see more and more applications that explore
+this capability: real-time gaming engines, simulators, hard real-time
+apps, etc.
+
+Current CPU isolation support consists of the following features:
+
+1. Isolated CPU(s) are excluded from the scheduler load balancing logic.
+   Applications must explicitly bind threads in order to run on those
+   CPU(s).
+
+2. By default interrupts are not routed to the isolated CPU(s).
+   Users must route interrupts (if any) to those CPU(s) explicitly.
+
+3. Kernel avoids any activity on the isolated CPU(s) as much as possible.
+   This includes workqueues, per CPU threads, etc.  Please note that
+   this feature is optional and is disabled by default.
+
+Kernel configuration options
+----------------------------
+
+Following options need to be enabled in order to use CPU isolation
+   CONFIG_CPUISOL		Top-level config option. Enables general
+                                CPU isolation framework and enables features 
+                                #1 and #2 described above.
+
+   CONFIG_CPUISOL_WORKQUEUE	These options provide deeper isolation
+   CONFIG_CPUISOL_STOPMACHINE   from various kernel subsystems. They implement 
+   CONFIG_CPUISOL_...           feature #3 described above.  
+                                See Kconfig help for more information on each 
+                                individual option.
+
+How to isolate a CPU
+--------------------
+
+There are two ways for isolating a CPU
+
+Kernel boot command line:
+   isolcpus=n0,n1,...
+
+   This option enables isolation for all CPU(s) specified in the comma 
+   separated list.
+   Example:
+        isolcpus=1,5
+
+Sysfs interface:
+   In order to isolate a CPU through this mechanism it must first be
+   brought off-line.  Hence the command sequence looks like:
+       echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/online
+       echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/isolated
+       echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/online
+
+
+Kernel interfaces
+-----------------
+
+cpu_isolated_map  - Bitmap of all isolated CPU(s).
+		    This bitmap is updated either by isolcpus= command
+		    line option or by writing to sysfs attributes. In
+		    the latter case isolation bit can be updated only
+		    when the corresponding CPU is off-line.
+
+cpu_isolated(N)   - Use that function to check whether CPU N is isolated.
+
+
+User-space application interfaces
+---------------------------------
+
+From the user-space application perspective isolated CPU(s) are no
+different from any other CPU in the system. Once the required CPU(s)
+have been isolated applications can use standard POSIX apis to bind its
+threads to those CPU(s):
+	sched_setaffinity
+	sched_getaffinity
+	pthread_getaffinity_np
+	pthread_setaffinity_np
+
+One thing to keep in mind though is that Linux kernel heavily uses per-CPU
+data structures and mechanisms. For example if a thread running on an
+isolated CPU makes a system call, that system call will be serviced
+on the same CPU.  Some system calls trigger timers, softirq and other
+kernel activities. Those will likely also run on the same CPU where
+system call was originally serviced.  If this behavior is undesirable
+threads running on the isolated CPU(s) should avoid using certain system
+calls and instead delegate that to the threads running on non-isolated
+CPU(s). For example you probably do not want to write to the filesystem
+or the console. Generally, time, mutex and pthread related system calls
+are perfectly safe.
+
+If you intend to use CPU isolation for real-time applications please
