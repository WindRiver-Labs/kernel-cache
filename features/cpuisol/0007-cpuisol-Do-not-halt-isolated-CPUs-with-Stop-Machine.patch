Subject: [PATCH 7/8] cpuisol: Do not halt isolated CPUs with Stop Machine

This patch makes "stop machine" ignore isolated CPUs (if the config option is enabled).

It addresses exact same usecase explained in the previous workqueue isolation patch.
Where a user-space RT thread can prevent stop machine threads from running, which causes
the entire system to hang.

Stop machine is particularly bad when it comes to latencies because it halts every single
CPU and may take several milliseconds to complete. It's currently used for module insertion
and removal only.
As some folks pointed out in the previous discussions this patch is potentially unsafe
if applications running on the isolated CPUs use kernel services affected by the module
insertion and removal.
I've been running kernels with this patch on a wide range of the machines in production
environment were we routinely insert/remove modules with applications running on isolated
CPUs. Also I've recently done quite a bit of testing on life multi-core systems with
"stop machine" _completely_ disabled, and was not able to trigger any problems.
For more details please see this thread
	http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=120243837206248&w=2
That of course does not mean that the patch is totally safe but it does not seem to
cause any instability in real life.

This feature does not add any overhead when disabled. It's marked as experimental
due to potential issues mentioned above.
