Subject: [PATCH] Revert "rcu: Make callers awaken grace-period kthread"

This reverts commit 35cbd149f07864e5d68c8368549a03609fddd1a3.

We are applying upstream rcu commits later on in this branch, and
having partial backports here from stable is problematic in
disrupting the commit order of the rcu content.

Revert it here so the actual mainline commit can be applied as-is
later on in the series of pending commits.
