Subject: [PATCH] rcu: Stop tracking FSF's postal address

commit 87de1cfdc55b16b794e245b07322340725149d62 upstream.

All of the RCU source files have the usual GPL header, which contains a
long-obsolete postal address for FSF.  To avoid the need to track the
FSF office's movements, this commit substitutes the URL where GPL may
be found.
