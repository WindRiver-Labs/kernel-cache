Subject: [PATCH] rcu: Don't use NMIs to dump other CPUs' stacks

commit bc1dce514e9b29b64df28a533015885862f47814 upstream.

Although NMI-based stack dumps are in principle more accurate, they are
also more likely to trigger deadlocks.  This commit therefore replaces
all uses of trigger_all_cpu_backtrace() with rcu_dump_cpu_stacks(), so
that the CPU detecting an RCU CPU stall does the stack dumping.
