Subject: [PATCH] rcutorture: Stop tracking FSF's postal address

commit 0e342a87d5f0cd06697c3fdc5e8b49c61e558231 upstream.

All of the rcutorture scripts has the usual GPL header, which contains
a long-obsolete postal address for FSF.  To avoid the need to track the
FSF office's movements, this commit substitutes the URL where GPL may
be found.
