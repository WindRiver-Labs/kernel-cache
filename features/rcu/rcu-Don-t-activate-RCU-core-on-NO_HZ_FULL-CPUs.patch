Subject: [PATCH] rcu: Don't activate RCU core on NO_HZ_FULL CPUs

commit a096932f0c9c9dca9cce72f1c0fb2395df8f2dff upstream.

Whenever a CPU receives a scheduling-clock interrupt, RCU checks to see
if the RCU core needs anything from this CPU.  If so, RCU raises
RCU_SOFTIRQ to carry out any needed processing.

This approach has worked well historically, but it is undesirable on
NO_HZ_FULL CPUs.  Such CPUs are expected to spend almost all of their time
in userspace, so that scheduling-clock interrupts can be disabled while
there is only one runnable task on the CPU in question.  Unfortunately,
raising any softirq has the potential to wake up ksoftirqd, which would
provide the second runnable task on that CPU, preventing disabling of
scheduling-clock interrupts.

What is needed instead is for RCU to leave NO_HZ_FULL CPUs alone,
relying on the grace-period kthreads' quiescent-state forcing to
do any needed RCU work on behalf of those CPUs.

This commit therefore refrains from raising RCU_SOFTIRQ on any
NO_HZ_FULL CPUs during any grace periods that have been in effect
for less than one second.  The one-second limit handles the case
where an inappropriate workload is running on a NO_HZ_FULL CPU
that features lots of scheduling-clock interrupts, but no idle
or userspace time.
