Subject: [PATCH] rcu: More info about potential deadlocks with
 rcu_read_unlock()

commit ce36f2f3eb6613a73bc6f3a5256bde7dd3f95710 upstream.

The comment above rcu_read_unlock() explains the potential deadlock
if the caller holds one of the locks taken by rt_mutex_unlock() paths,
but it is not clear from this documentation that any lock which can
be taken from interrupt can lead to deadlock as well and we need to
take rt_mutex_lock() into account too.

The problem is that rt_mutex_lock() takes wait_lock without disabling
irqs, and thus an interrupt taking some LOCK can obviously race with
rcu_read_unlock_special() called with the same LOCK held.
