Subject: [PATCH] rcu: Remove stale comment in tree.c

commit 66d701ea7e148f8ed8b1497c9159fbf6175d462f upstream.

This commit removes a stale comment in rcu/tree.c which was left
out when some code was moved around previously in commit 2036d94a7b61
("rcu:  Rework detection of use of RCU by offline CPUs") For reference,
the following updated comment exists a few lines below this which means
the same:

/* Remove the outgoing CPU from the masks in the rcu_node hierarchy. */
