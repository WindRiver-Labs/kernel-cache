Subject: [PATCH 1218/1566] devicetree: Add Xilinx AMS binding documentation

commit  cf002ddacb7384371b96ccc4c215ae9d26b89cd2 from
https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx.git

The AMS includes an ADC as well as on-chip sensors that can be used to
sample external voltages and monitor on-die operating conditions, such as
temperature and supply voltage levels. The AMS has two SYSMON blocks.
PL-SYSMON block is capable of monitoring off chip voltage and temperature.
PL-SYSMON block has DRP, JTAG and I2C interface to enable monitoring from
external master. Out of these interface currently only DRP is supported.
Other block PS-SYSMON is memory mapped to PS. Both the blocks has built-in
alarm generation logic that is used to interrupt the processor based on
condition set.

Each of them needs:
* An address range where the registers are mapped
* An interrupt number for the device interrupt

Additionally devicetree binding describe which external channels are
connected and in which configuration.

+Xilinx AMS device driver
+
+The AMS includes an ADC as well as on-chip sensors that can be used to
+sample external voltages and monitor on-die operating conditions, such as
+temperature and supply voltage levels. The AMS has two SYSMON blocks.
+PL-SYSMON block is capable of monitoring off chip voltage and temperature.
+PL-SYSMON block has DRP, JTAG and I2C interface to enable monitoring from
+external master. Out of this interface currenlty only DRP is supported.
+Other block PS-SYSMON is memory mapped to PS. Both of block has built-in
+alarm generation logic that is used to interrupt the processor based on
+condition set.
+
+All designs should have AMS register, but PS and PL are optional depending on
+the design. The driver can work with only PS, only PL and both PS and PL
+configurations. Please specify registers according to your design. DTS file
+should always have AMS module property. Providing PS & PL module is optional.
+
+Required properties:
+	- compatible: Should be "xlnx,zynqmp-ams"
+	- reg:  Should specify AMS register space
+	- interrupts: Interrupt number for the AMS control interface
+	- interrupt-names: Interrupt name, must be "ams-irq"
+	- ranges: keep the property empty to map child address space
+	          (for PS and/or PL) nodes 1:1 onto the parent address
+	          space
+
+AMS device tree subnode:
+	- compatible: Should be "xlnx,zynqmp-ams-ps" or "xlnx,zynqmp-ams-pl"
+	- reg:  Register space for PS or PL
+
+Optional properties:
+
+Following optional property only valid for PL.
+	- xlnx,ext-channels: List of external channels that are connected to the
+	                     AMS PL module.
+
+	  The child nodes of this node represent the external channels which are
+	  connected to the AMS Module. If the property is not present
+	  no external channels will be assumed to be connected.
+
+	  Each child node represents one channel and has the following
+	  properties:
+		Required properties:
+			* reg: Pair of pins the channel is connected to.
+				0: VP/VN
+				1: VUSER0
+				2: VUSER1
+				3: VUSER3
+				4: VUSER4
+				5: VAUXP[0]/VAUXN[0]
+				6: VAUXP[1]/VAUXN[1]
+				...
+				20: VAUXP[15]/VAUXN[15]
+			  Note each channel number should only be used at most
+			  once.
+		Optional properties:
+			* xlnx,bipolar: If set the channel is used in bipolar
+			  mode.
+
+
+Example:
+	xilinx_ams: ams@ffa50000 {
+		compatible = "xlnx,zynqmp-ams";
+		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
+		interrupts = <0 56 4>;
+		interrupt-names = "ams-irq";
+		reg = <0x0 0xffa50000 0x0 0x800>;
+		reg-names = "ams-base";
+		#address-cells = <2>;
+		#size-cells = <2>;
+		ranges;
+
+		ams_ps: ams_ps@ffa50800 {
+			compatible = "xlnx,zynqmp-ams-ps";
+			reg = <0x0 0xffa50800 0x0 0x400>;
+		};
+
+		ams_pl: ams_pl@ffa50c00 {
+			compatible = "xlnx,zynqmp-ams-pl";
+			reg = <0x0 0xffa50c00 0x0 0x400>;
+			xlnx,ext-channels {
+				#address-cells = <1>;
+				#size-cells = <0>;
+				channel@0 {
+					reg = <0>;
+					xlnx,bipolar;
+				};
+				channel@1 {
+					reg = <1>;
+				};
+				channel@8 {
+					reg = <8>;
+					xlnx,bipolar;
+				};
+			};
+		};
+	};
