Subject: [PATCH 1405/1566] rtc: zynqmp: Disable module option in Kconfig

commit  00a16cc47f04a61c12b1d7896ea068c0c34e1157 from
https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx.git

There is an issue with alarmtimer core which keeps
reference for the first registered alarmtimer.

Issue was likely introduced by:
"alarmtimers: Rework RTC device selection using class interface"
(sha1: 8bc0dafb5cf38a19484dfb16e2c6d29e85820046)

There needs to be different fix to make this works
but there are cases where alarmtimer shouldn't be removed(wake up
source).

This patch fixes the issue where you load rtc-zynqmp module
and remove it and load again and you don't get the same dev id
from aliases.

Error log:
root@linaro-alip:~# modprobe rtc_zynqmp
[   35.879655] rtc_zynqmp ffa60000.rtc: /aliases ID 0 not available
[   35.886002] rtc_zynqmp ffa60000.rtc: rtc core: registered
ffa60000.rtc as rtc1

This patch simply disables module selection and it is preventing issue
above. By purpose driver itself it not changed till mainline discussion
is finished.
