Subject: [PATCH 0701/1566] media: i2c: adv7511: Fix use with DT

The DT bindings added in commit:

b983a5a3303f68a2b9422deb452ff5e5cd3b806c
("media: i2c: adv7511: Add DT binding to this driver")

were added before support for infoframes were added in commit:

b4dbad8fe3b60466e0d364b34c075117757838f2
("[media] adv7511: log the currently set infoframes")

With the infoframes added, DT based use of the driver will fail to find
the pktmem I2C device and fail to load.

Add a pktmem-addr device tree binding (similar to the edid-addr)
to enable this address to be specified.

Add a cec-addr device tree binding as well, for future use.
