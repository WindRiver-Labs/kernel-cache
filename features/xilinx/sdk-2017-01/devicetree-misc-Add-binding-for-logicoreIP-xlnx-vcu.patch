Subject: [PATCH 1343/1566] devicetree: misc: Add binding for logicoreIP
 xlnx,vcu

commit  09d7ae763adf950d55fd29c33697626e74416cac from
https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx.git

Added the txt file which contain the xlnx,vcu DT node
properties information. This also provides the information
of it's child node as well.

+Xilinx VCU init Driver
+-----------------------------
+
+General concept
+---------------
+
+Xilinx VCU init driver is developed to handle the LogiCore related
+new implementation. In this directory, The DT node of the Xilinx
+VCU init driver represents as a top level node.
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible: Must be "xlnx,vcu".
+- reg, reg-names: There are two sets of registers need to provide.
+	1. vcu slcr
+	2. Logicore
+	reg-names should contain name for the each register sequence.
+- clocks: phandle for aclk and pll_ref clocksource
+- clock-names: The identification string, "aclk", is always required for
+   the axi clock. "pll_ref" is required for pll.
+- ranges
+- VCU Init driver node define the following child nodes:
+	* Allegro encoder driver node
+		- compatible: Must be "al,al5e"
+		- reg: There is a one set of register.
+		- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
+		- interrupt-parent: the phandle for the interrupt controller
+		  that services interrupts for this device.
+	* Allegro decoder driver node
+		- compatible: Must be "al,al5d"
+		- reg: There is a one set of register.
+		- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
+		- interrupt-parent: the phandle for the interrupt controller
+		  that services interrupts for this device.
+Example:
+
+	xlnx_vcu: vcu@a0040000 {
+		compatible = "xlnx,vcu";
+		#address-cells = <2>;
+		#size-cells = <2>;
+		reg = <0x0 0xa0040000 0x0 0x1000>,
+			 <0x0 0xa0041000 0x0 0x1000>;
+		reg-names = "vcu_slcr", "logicore";
+		clocks = <&si570_1>, <&clkc 71>;
+		clock-names = "pll_ref", "aclk";
+		ranges;
+		encoder: al5e@a0000000 {
+			compatible = "al,al5e";
+			reg = <0x0 0xa0000000 0x0 0x10000>;
+			interrupts = <0 89 4>;
+			interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
+		};
+
+		decoder: al5d@a0020000 {
+			compatible = "al,al5d";
+			reg = <0x0 0xa0020000 0x0 0x10000>;
+			interrupts = <0 89 4>;
+			interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
+		};
+	};
