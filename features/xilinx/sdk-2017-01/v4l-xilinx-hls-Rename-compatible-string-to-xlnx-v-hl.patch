Subject: [PATCH 0460/1566] v4l: xilinx: hls: Rename compatible string to
 xlnx,v-hls

This matches the compatible string values used by the DT generator.

-Xilinx High-Level Synthesis Core (HLS)
---------------------------------------
-
-High-Level Synthesis cores are synthesized from a high-level function
-description developed by the user. As such their functions vary widely, but
-they all share a set of common characteristics that allow them to be described
-by common bindings.
-
-
-Required properties:
-
-- compatible: This property must contain "xlnx,axi-hls" to indicate that the
-  core is compatible with the generic Xilinx HLS DT bindings. It can also
-  contain a more specific string to identify the HLS core implementation. The
-  value of those implementation-specific strings is out of scope for these DT
-  bindings.
-
-- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers sets for the device.
-  The HLS core has two registers sets, the first one contains the core
-  standard registers and the second one contains the custom user registers.
-
-- clocks: Reference to the video core clock.
-
-- ports: Video ports, using the DT bindings defined in ../video-interfaces.txt.
-  The HLS core has one input port (0) and one output port (1).
-
-Required port properties:
-
-- xlnx,axi-video-format: Video format as defined in video.txt.
-- xlnx,axi-video-width: Video width as defined in video.txt.
-
-Example:
-
-	axi_hls_0: axi_hls@43c00000 {
-		compatible = "xlnx,axi-hls-sobel", "xlnx,axi-hls";
-		reg = <0x43c00000 0x24>, <0x43c00024 0xa0>;
-		clocks = <&clkc 15>;
-
-		ports {
-			#address-cells = <1>;
-			#size-cells = <0>;
-
-			port@0 {
-				reg = <0>;
-
-				xlnx,axi-video-format = "yuv422";
-				xlnx,axi-video-width = <8>;
-
-				hls0_in: endpoint {
-					remote-endpoint = <&vdma_out>;
-				};
-			};
-			port@1 {
-				reg = <1>;
-
-				xlnx,axi-video-format = "yuv422";
