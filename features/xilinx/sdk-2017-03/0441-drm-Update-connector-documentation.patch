Subject: [PATCH 441/532] drm: Update connector documentation

commit ae2a6da8762985fc238eea81b88c3b982f1c37bc from
https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx.git

- Shuffle docs from drm-kms.rst into the structure docs where it makes
  sense.
- Put the remaining bits into a new overview section.

One thing I've changed is around probing: Old docs says that you
_must_ use the probe helpers, which isn't correct. Helpers are always
optional.

v2: Review from Sean.

+/**
+ * DOC: overview
+ *
+ * In DRM connectors are the general abstraction for display sinks, and include
+ * als fixed panels or anything else that can display pixels in some form. As
+ * opposed to all other KMS objects representing hardware (like CRTC, encoder or
+ * plane abstractions) connectors can be hotplugged and unplugged at runtime.
+ * Hence they are reference-counted using drm_connector_reference() and
+ * drm_connector_unreference().
+ *
+ * KMS driver must create, initialize, register and attach at a struct
+ * &drm_connector for each such sink. The instance is created as other KMS
+ * objects and initialized by setting the following fields.
+ *
+ * The connector is then registered with a call to drm_connector_init() with a
+ * pointer to the connector functions and a connector type, and exposed through
+ * sysfs with a call to drm_connector_register().
+ *
+ * Connectors must be attached to an encoder to be used. For devices that map
+ * connectors to encoders 1:1, the connector should be attached at
+ * initialization time with a call to drm_mode_connector_attach_encoder(). The
+ * driver must also set the struct &drm_connector encoder field to point to the
+ * attached encoder.
+ *
+ * For connectors which are not fixed (like built-in panels) the driver needs to
+ * support hotplug notifications. The simplest way to do that is by using the
+ * probe helpers, see drm_kms_helper_poll_init() for connectors which don't have
+ * hardware support for hotplug interrupts. Connectors with hardware hotplug
+ * support can instead use e.g. drm_helper_hpd_irq_event().
