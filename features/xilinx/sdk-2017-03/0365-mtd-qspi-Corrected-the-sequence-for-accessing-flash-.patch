Subject: [PATCH 365/532] mtd: qspi: Corrected the sequence for accessing flash
 part

commit 45b0d9a1507edb3c4e4bb37f04dcb8581a74d501 from
https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx.git

For accessing flash part using the mtd devices for architectures which
only supports 3 byte addressing need to call write_ear() for accessing
memory above 16MB. After every call to write_ear(), write_enable()
has to be called for further process.
