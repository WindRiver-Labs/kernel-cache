Subject: [PATCH 301/532] Documentation: devicetree: r5 remoteproc: describe
 IPI as optional

commit aa70e5801b949fa18248863c4625d438571e9f70 from
https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx.git

As IPI is not required if user uses remoteproc only to load the RPU
firmware, we should say IPI is optional in the device tree binding.
