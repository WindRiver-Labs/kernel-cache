Subject: [PATCH 135/532] arm64: zynqmp: Reduced min-residency time for idle
 state node

commit d1311066e3dcac2000b38e03ccb41358ed2ce42b from
https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx.git

Changed min-residence to 10ms(was 100 ms) for cpu-sleep-0.
Tried lower values 5ms and 8ms and it worked fine with Debug Off.
But to accommodate PM Debug On case, 10 ms is required. With this
change, low power idle state is into effect more frequently.
Measured boot time with PM debugs On and Off. No change observed
compared to 100ms value.
