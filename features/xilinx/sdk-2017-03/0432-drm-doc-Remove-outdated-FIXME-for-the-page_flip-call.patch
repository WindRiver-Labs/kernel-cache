Subject: [PATCH 432/532] drm/doc: Remove outdated FIXME for the page_flip
 callback

commit ecfd8efcf7f9ba9eadb23a98d9eb9d5586b868e7 from
https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx.git

Since the drm_event cleanup work (as prep for fence support) drivers
don't need to bother themselves any more with this, the drm event core
takes care of that.
