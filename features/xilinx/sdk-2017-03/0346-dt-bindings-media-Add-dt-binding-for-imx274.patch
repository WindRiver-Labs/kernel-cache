+* Sony 1/2.5-Inch 8.51Mp CMOS Digital Image Sensor
+
+The Sony imx274 is a 1/2.5-inch CMOS active pixel digital image sensor with
+an active array size of 3864H x 2202V. It is programmable through I2C
+interface. The I2C address is fixed to 0x1a as per sensor data sheet.
+Image data is sent through MIPI CSI-2, which is configured as 4 lanes
+at 1440 Mbps.
+
+
+Required Properties:
+- compatible: value should be "sony,imx274" for imx274 sensor
+
+Optional Properties:
+- reset-gpios: Sensor reset GPIO
+
+For further reading on port node refer to
+Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.
+
+Example:
+	imx274: sensor@1a{
+		compatible = "sony,imx274";
+		reg = <0x1a>;
+		#address-cells = <1>;
+		#size-cells = <0>;
+		reset-gpios = <&gpio_sensor 0 0>;
+		port@0 {
+			reg = <0>;
+			sensor_out: endpoint {
+				remote-endpoint = <&csiss_in>;
+			};
+		};
+	};
