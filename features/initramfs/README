Subject: README file for initramfs feature

This feature template enables support for initramfs. This file contains
three parts:

1.What's initramfs
2.How to build it in Wind River Linux
3.How to use it in target board


1.What's initramfs
==================

initramfs is an alternative, simpler method of having files available at boot
time without having them in a persistent mountable filesystem. It's linked in
the kernel file when compiling the kernel. So we can boot the target board
only using the kernel with initramfs. For more details, please refer
to linux/Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt

2.How to build it in Wind River Linux
=====================================

After configuring a BSP using Wind River Linux, following command will
generate a kernel with initramfs support:

 $make boot-image BOOTIMAGE_FSTYPE=initramfs BOOTIMAGE_TYPE=flash

Then the file of "export/<BSP>-initramfs" will be the kernel with initramfs.
Because initramfs is designed for small filesystem, it's recommended to use
glibc_small and uclibc_small to configure a BSP. If using glibc_std or
glibc_cgl, it may make the kernel rather big and can't boot in the target board.

By default, kernel use "export/dist" as source of initramfs. Also user can use
"INITRAMFS_SOURCE" parameter to specify customized file system as
source of initramfs. The parameter can point to a cpio file or a directory
contains file system.

 - specify a cpio file

   First use cpio command to create a cpio file and then provide to
   INITRAMFS_SOURCE with absolute path:

 $make boot-image BOOTIMAGE_FSTYPE=initramfs BOOTIMAGE_TYPE=flash \
   INITRAMFS_SOURCE=/absolute/path/to/initramfs/rootfs.cpio

   INITRAMFS_SOURCE also supports a compressed cpio file, compressed by
   gzip, bzip2 or lzma.

 - specify a directory

   If a directory is specified, it must has "/init" file, which is
   a execute file or a link to other execute file. Also the directory
   must be a absolute path.

 $make boot-image BOOTIMAGE_FSTYPE=initramfs BOOTIMAGE_TYPE=flash \
   INITRAMFS_SOURCE=/absolute/path/to/directory/of/initramfs/

3.How to use it in target board
===============================

Because the kernel with initramfs already contains root filesystem, when
booting the kernel, we must not pass any "root=/dev/xxx"(xxx means nfs,
hda1 etc.) to kernel cmdline, otherwise the kernel won't use the initramfs
as root filesystem. Besides this, booting the kernel with initramfs
doesn't need special steps.

It should be noted that on powerpc arch:
Because the kernel often needs dtb file loaded after 2MBytes space from the
kernel loading address, if the kernel size is larger than 2MByts, the kernel
will overlap with the dtb, which will lead to the kernel booting failure.
Please modify loading address of the dtb file to fit the kernel size.
e.g.
The kernel size is 5MBytes, loading address of the kernel is 0x200000 and the
default dtb loading address is 0x400000. Then the dtb loading address will be
changed to 0x200000 + 0x500000(5MBytes) = 0x700000
