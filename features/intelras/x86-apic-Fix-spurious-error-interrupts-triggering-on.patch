Subject: [PATCH 16/49] x86, apic: Fix spurious error interrupts triggering on all non-boot APs

Upstream ID: e503f9e4b092e2349a9477a333543de8f3c7f5d9

This patch fixes a bug reported by a customer, who found
that many unreasonable error interrupts reported on all
non-boot CPUs (APs) during the system boot stage.

According to Chapter 10 of Intel Software Developer Manual
Volume 3A, Local APIC may signal an illegal vector error when
an LVT entry is set as an illegal vector value (0~15) under
FIXED delivery mode (bits 8-11 is 0), regardless of whether
the mask bit is set or an interrupt actually happen. These
errors are seen as error interrupts.

The initial value of thermal LVT entries on all APs always reads
0x10000 because APs are woken up by BSP issuing INIT-SIPI-SIPI
sequence to them and LVT registers are reset to 0s except for
the mask bits which are set to 1s when APs receive INIT IPI.

When the BIOS takes over the thermal throttling interrupt,
the LVT thermal deliver mode should be SMI and it is required
from the kernel to keep AP's LVT thermal monitoring register
programmed as such as well.

This issue happens when BIOS does not take over thermal throttling
interrupt, AP's LVT thermal monitor register will be restored to
0x10000 which means vector 0 and fixed deliver mode, so all APs will
signal illegal vector error interrupts.

This patch check if interrupt delivery mode is not fixed mode before
restoring AP's LVT thermal monitor register.
