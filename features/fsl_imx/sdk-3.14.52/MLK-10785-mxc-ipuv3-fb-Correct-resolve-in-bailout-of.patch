Subject: [PATCH 0479/1221] MLK-10785 mxc ipuv3 fb: Correct ->resolve in
 bailout of ->set_par due to no PRE

We should set mxcfbi->resolve to be false in the bailout path of ops->set_par
due to no PRE is available.  Otherwise, the users may call the PAN_DISPLAY
ioctrl to switch buffer right after the bailout path and accidently runs the
resolving logic for switching buffer.
