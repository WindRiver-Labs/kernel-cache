Subject: [PATCH 0381/1221] MLK-10608 ASoC: imx-wm8958: playback 24 bit 44k
 and 48k wave will get big noise

According to the wm8958 referance manual, DAC sample rate 44.1k and 48k
are supported for 24 bit word length when it is 'simple' DAC-only
playback modes. But after test, we found that it would get big noise
which can't be eliminated by configuring codec register. It should be
the codec hardward limitation, and we can't support these sample rate.
