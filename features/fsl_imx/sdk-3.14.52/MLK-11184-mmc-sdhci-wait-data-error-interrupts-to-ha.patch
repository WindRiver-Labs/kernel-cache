Subject: [PATCH 0901/1221] MLK-11184 mmc: sdhci: wait data error interrupts
 to handle transfer error for data commands

Due to the data may be still in transferring if a cmd error of data
command happens, the next quick reset during data transfer may cause host
controller unpridicable issues.
e.g. On MX6Q/MX6QP, if reset during ADMA is busy moving data from FIFO to
memory, we can observe 32 bytes lost issue sometimes in a very lower
possibility especially for SD3.0 cards because the tuning command can easily
fail on cmd error before data transfer complete.

Let's using data error interrupts to handle transfer error of a
data command instead of only checking cmd error, then can make sure
the next safe reset only happens when data transfer is done.

After fixing, the SD3.0 can pass 3 days reboot stress test while it could
easily fail on only one night stress test before.
