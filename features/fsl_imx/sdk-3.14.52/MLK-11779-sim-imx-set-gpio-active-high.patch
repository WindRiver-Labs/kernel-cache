Subject: [PATCH 1180/1221] MLK-11779 sim: imx: set gpio active high

Sim card CVCC is determined by the gpio value from sim controller.
How the CVCC is controlled on both post card boards is decribed below.

NCN8025:Vcc=ACTIVE_HIGH?5V:3V
TDA8035:Vcc=ACTIVE_HIGH?5V:1.8V

Different sim cards have different CVCC range. To support all cards
with same dts, this patch set gpio active high.
