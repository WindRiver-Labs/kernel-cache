Subject: [PATCH 0359/1221] MLK-10629-5 dts: imx7d-sdb: remove non-removable
 property of wifi host

The card detect of Broadcom WiFi on uSDHC2 port can not function
well with a non-removalbe card. Because MMC core only enumerate
one time for non-removable card which is not work for Broadcom WiFI.
So remove it.
