Subject: [PATCH 0669/1221] MLK-9617-6 usb: core: otg: do not break otg device
 enumeration

If a HNP capable device STALL b_hnp_enable set feature request, A device
as host should not break otg device enumeration, because this set feature
failure only indicates the B device does not want to be host role for the
moment, A device as host talk to it should be okay.

see charpter 6.2.2.2 of OTG and EH 2.0:
"If the a_hnp_support feature is set, but the b_hnp_enable feature is not set,
then it is likely that b_hnp_enable will be set later when the A-device is
finished using the bus."
