Subject: [PATCH 1052/1221] MLK-11453 ARM: imx: fix the wrong address types in
 mcc

In mcc_recv_nocopy, Before dequeuing a buffer from
the endpoint list, translate its address from a
virtual address to a physical address, as the
dequeue buffer function expects a physical address.

When attempting to use the mcc_msgs_available function,
a kernel oops would sometimes occur. This was caused by
the memory addresses that were accessed being physical
rather than virtual. Converting the memory addresses
to virtual addresses fixes this issue.
