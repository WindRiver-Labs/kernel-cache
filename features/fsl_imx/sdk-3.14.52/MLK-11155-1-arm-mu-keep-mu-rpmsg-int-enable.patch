Subject: [PATCH 0842/1221] MLK-11155-1 arm: mu: keep mu rpmsg int enable

Keep the mu rpmsg int always enable.
- rpmsg transmissions are async, and drived by mu interactions
between the amp cores.
- the schedule delay is not real time mechanism, the mu
interactions maybe blocked by the previous rpmsg int disable
when there are very quick intercations between the amp cores.
Solution:
Keep mu rpmsg int always enable, since it is just to notify
rpmsg master that there is buffer to read, and can be re-entry
multi-times.
