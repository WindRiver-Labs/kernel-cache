Subject: [PATCH 0957/1221] MLK-11277 dts: imx7d-sdb: add ramp up delay for
 VDD_SD1 regulator

We met a strange issue that with a HDMI pannel connected, the SD DDR50 cards
sometimes fail to be enumurated with CRC errors as follows:
mmc0: new ultra high speed DDR50 SDHC card at address e624
mmcblk0: mmc0:e624 SL08G 7.40 GiB
mmcblk0: error -84 transferring data, sector 0, nr 8, cmd response 0x900, card status 0xb00
mmcblk0: retrying using single block read
mmcblk0: error -84 transferring data, sector 0, nr 8, cmd response 0x900, card status 0x0
end_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 0

But without HDMI connected, no such issue.

We suspect the issue is related to VDD_SD1 regulator which is somehow
affected by HDMI, the patch add a bit delay for VDD_SD1 regulator to ensure
enough ramp up time to be stable.

The reboot stress tested 2 days and did not meet the issue again.
Formerly it usually can fail with tens of reboot test.

This issue currently can only be reproduced on Android environment.
We also adds the fix for Linux in case it has the issue too.
