Subject: [PATCH 1088/1594] MLK-10894 pci: imx: Error message and kernel dump
 happens after resume

commit 31853d6d82b143b07d584a69b0023fa2176cc644 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

phenomena:
There is no such kind of phenomen when the "no_consol_suspend"
is added into kernel cmd line.
But there maybe kernel dump when the "no_consol_suspend" is
removed from kernel cmd line.
Root cause:
After the RC resume back and link is up, delay for a while is
required to let ep to resume from D3 mode
Regarding to RM DOC, no status bit can be used to make a
check on it, thus a while delay had been added.
Test results: Over weekend stress tests are passed.
