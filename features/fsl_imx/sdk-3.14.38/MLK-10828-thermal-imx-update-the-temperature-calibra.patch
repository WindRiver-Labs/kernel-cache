Subject: [PATCH 1284/1594] MLK-10828 thermal: imx: update the temperature
 calibration data for i.mx6

commit c93424a3926c908d811235871cc419c7bfad9b4f from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

According to the design team:

After a thorough accuracy study of the Temp sense circuit,we found that
with our current equation, an average part can read 7 degrees lower than
a known forced temperature. We also found out that the standard variance
was around 2C; which is the tightest distribution that we could create. We
need to change the temp sense equation to center the average
part around the target temperature.

Old Equation:

Temp = Troom,cal - slope*(Count measured - Count room fuse)
Where Troom,cal = 25C  and Slope = 0.4297157 - (0.0015974 * Count room fuse)

New Equation:

Temp = Troom,cal - slope*(Count measured - Count room fuse) +offset
Where Troom,cal = 25C  and Slope = 0.4148468 - (0.0015423 * Count room fuse)
Offset = 3.580661
