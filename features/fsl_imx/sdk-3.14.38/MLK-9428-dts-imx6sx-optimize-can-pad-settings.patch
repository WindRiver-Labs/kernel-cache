Subject: [PATCH 0811/1594] MLK-9428 dts: imx6sx: optimize can pad settings

commit b3755bce748ef206b16e1c2505c277bcfb5eab90 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

Detailed reproduce steps:
1. boot-up to Linux command prompt.
2. send data from CAN device using "candump" command.
3. capture the TXD waveform during transmission.
4. severe overshoot/undershoot is observed (+4.4V ~ -1.2V).

HW team found that the pad setting of the CAN signal pins is not optimized.
In existing BSP, SPEED/DSE/SRE = 10/110/1 is used. They propose change it
to SPEED/DSE/SRE = 00/100/0.
