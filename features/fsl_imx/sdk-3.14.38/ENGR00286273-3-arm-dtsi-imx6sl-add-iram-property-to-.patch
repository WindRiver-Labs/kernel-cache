Subject: [PATCH 0359/1594] ENGR00286273-3 arm: dtsi: imx6sl: add iram
 property to support internal SRAM

commit 177414833120188b7133e491a95be0644eeb84a1 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

By doing this, we can allow SDMA driver to allocate its memory from iram
when using i.MX6 SoloLite SoC.

Signed-off-by: Nicolin Chen <b42378@freescale.com>
(cherry picked from commit aa527b38d52af233641edc500acae0e6212ccdb3)
