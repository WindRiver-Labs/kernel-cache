Subject: [PATCH 0867/1594] MLK-10228 dts: imx6qdl-sabreauto: remove SDb WP
 pin which is not connect by default

commit 53e41da546c9eb6cc7ce33d5e4acc430081e204c from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

SDb WP pin is not connected by default on MX6Q CPU2 board, so we removed it
in DTS file. BTW, SDb slot is designed for WiFi slot, it is ok to disable WP
for old CPU board also.
