Subject: [PATCH 1095/1594] MLK-10923 arm: pci: use the i2c expansion perst on
 imx6qp

commit df02e66e628b108cb802370924f40dcdcadd6da9 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

Base on the following commit, use the i2c expansion
gpio as the pcie perst on imx6qp ard board.

"ab13b0e11c50021905de00a0f3c0df7e0a36a3f0"
i2c: imx: add irqf_no_suspend

The i2c irq is masked when pcie starts a i2c transfer process
during noirq suspend stage. As a result, i2c transfer fails.
To solve the problem, IRQF_NO_SUSPEND is added to i2c bus.
