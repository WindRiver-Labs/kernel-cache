Subject: [PATCH 0229/1594] ENGR00288196 ARM: dts: fix epdc and csi conflict
 on imx6sl evk

commit 0f6493b7610c484a464c0ade737863d2af62efc7 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

There is pinmux conflict for EPDC and I2C3 on imx6sl soc.
While on imx6sl evk board, the camera is attached on I2C3 bus, so the
EPDC function and CSI function can not be used at same time.
This patch removes the conflict in imx6sl-evk.dts file for EPDC function
and adds a new dts file for CSI function.

Signed-off-by: Robby Cai <R63905@freescale.com>
(cherry picked from commit eb6ffc9b8104c84a7a26295e9be89b8cce82a6a1)
