Subject: [PATCH 1360/1594] MLK-10101-4 usb: add otg_fsm pointer in usb_bus

commit c118afccbbb1c78938c649ee72758213c22cf489 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

Add otg_fsm pointer in struct of usb_bus for access otg_fsm via bus.
Original way was to put it in usb_otg, then usb host can access otg_fsm via
hcd->usb_phy->otg->fsm, since usb_phy will not be the future direction, instead
phy is prefered, so this way may not work. It's more direct and simple to put
it in usb_bus.
