Subject: [PATCH 0380/1594] MLK-10244-12 ARM: dts: imx7d-12x12-arm2: keep v33
 always on

commit fe039ea2e1dee6ad7a2b4e6c95730b67c6167c8c from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

Keep v33 always on because of many devices on imx7d-12x12-arm2 board use
it as power of pull up/down.

Signed-off-by: Robin Gong <b38343@freescale.com>
(cherry picked from commit 2d2fe7c257124d77ab4d0d5ea0c21049d1a59cbc)
