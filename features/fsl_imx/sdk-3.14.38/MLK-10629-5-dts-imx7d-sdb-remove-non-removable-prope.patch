Subject: [PATCH 0954/1594] MLK-10629-5 dts: imx7d-sdb: remove non-removable
 property of wifi host

commit 8238e2a07286f936b4522bc8305a30f99d91264d from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

The card detect of Broadcom WiFi on uSDHC2 port can not function
well with a non-removalbe card. Because MMC core only enumerate
one time for non-removable card which is not work for Broadcom WiFI.
So remove it.
