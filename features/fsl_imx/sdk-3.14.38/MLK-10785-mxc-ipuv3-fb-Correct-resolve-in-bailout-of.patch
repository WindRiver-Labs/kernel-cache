Subject: [PATCH 1022/1594] MLK-10785 mxc ipuv3 fb: Correct ->resolve in
 bailout of ->set_par due to no PRE

commit 8dbc47fc7a449d6ec1eb02a80c595f8dc0ed738a from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

We should set mxcfbi->resolve to be false in the bailout path of ops->set_par
due to no PRE is available.  Otherwise, the users may call the PAN_DISPLAY
ioctrl to switch buffer right after the bailout path and accidently runs the
resolving logic for switching buffer.
