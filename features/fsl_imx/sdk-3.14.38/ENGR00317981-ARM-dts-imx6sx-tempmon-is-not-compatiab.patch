Subject: [PATCH 0040/1594] ENGR00317981: ARM: dts: imx6sx: tempmon is not
 compatiable with imx6q

commit 5af4ff28a3913e22c061c2ad9fb19bb91824a218 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

The TEMPMON on imx6q has only one alarm value to program, while the one
on imx6sx support 3, Panic, High and Low.  So let's drop
fsl,imx6q-tempmon from its compatible.
