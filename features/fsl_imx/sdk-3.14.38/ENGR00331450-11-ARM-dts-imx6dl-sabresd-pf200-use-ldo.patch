Subject: [PATCH 0171/1594] ENGR00331450-11: ARM: dts: imx6dl-sabresd-pf200:
 use ldo-enable mode

commit 0ff0b3ef70525480da8ab88d409fa9e195556cef from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

For pfuze200, we have to use ldo-enable mode, because VDDARM_IN and VDDSOC_IN
share the same regulator.
Add GPL license head.
