Subject: [PATCH 0369/1594] MLK-10079 ARM: dts: imx6q-sabresd-uart: Disabled
 the LEDS node in the imx6q-sabresd-uart.dts.

commit ecc82e1bddb3872b440452d73e7b5e20c512d292 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

Silex UART BT is using GPIO1_2 as the reset, which is in conflict with
the one used by charging LEDS.
