Subject: [PATCH 0860/1594] MLK-10210 WIFI: ath6kl: Fixed the issue that
 warning messages were printed when uninstalling
 ath6kl_sdio after iperf test.

commit ba6cfa16706c8716a9c2a876633434196c0bcaaa from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

When handing the command "ifconfig wlan0 down", the driver handler did
not notify the disconnected event to the upper layer stack cfg80211,
which would cause the relating resources unable to be released. A
notification of disconnet event to cfg80211 was added when the driver
was changed to the disconnect state.
