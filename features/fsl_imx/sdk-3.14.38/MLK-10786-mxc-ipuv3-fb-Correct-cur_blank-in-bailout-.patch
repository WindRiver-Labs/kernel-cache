Subject: [PATCH 1023/1594] MLK-10786 mxc ipuv3 fb: Correct ->cur_blank in
 bailout of ->set_par due to no PRE

commit 9fa9bd08ba36f85868018ccae9d963c9c0400be8 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

We should set mxcfbi->cur_blank to be FB_BLANK_POWERDOWN in the bailout path
of ops->set_par due to no PRE is available since the engine will be stopped
scanning out frames in this case.  Otherwise, the users may call the PAN_DISPLAY
ioctrl to switch buffer right after the bailout path and accidently access the
IPUv3 registers without the IPUv3 HSP clock being enabled - the system hangs up.
