Subject: [PATCH 1212/1594] MLK-11065-8 bcmdhd: fixed build errors with 3.9.2
 toolchain

commit 0ae5c2480431dcea091cf9471b9e3b17b1774716 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

  CC [M]  drivers/net/wireless/bcmdhd/dhd_ip.o
  LD [M]  fs/udf/udf.o
drivers/net/wireless/bcmdhd/dhd_common.c:108:22: error: macro "__DATE__" might prevent reproducible builds [-Werror=date-time]
  DHD_COMPILED " on " __DATE__ " at " __TIME__;

drivers/net/wireless/bcmdhd/dhd_common.c:108:38: error: macro "__TIME__" might prevent reproducible builds [-Werror=date-time]
  DHD_COMPILED " on " __DATE__ " at " __TIME__;

Drop debug version with build date/time.
The kernel already has this information, and individual drivers
shouldn't duplicate that.  This also eliminates the use of __DATE__ and
__TIME__, which make the build non-deterministic.
