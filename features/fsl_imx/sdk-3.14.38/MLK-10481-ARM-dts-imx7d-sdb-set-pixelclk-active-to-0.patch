Subject: [PATCH 0902/1594] MLK-10481 ARM: dts: imx7d-sdb: set pixelclk-active
 to 0 for AT043TN24 panel

commit 84d5b5d590b218313ccc0156d1d510acc0961f32 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

According to the timing diagram of 43T panel, the data is launched
at negative edge of pixel clock and captured at positive edge.
Thus need to set pixelclk-active to 0.
