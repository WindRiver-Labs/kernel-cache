Subject: [PATCH 0200/1594] ENGR00327300 ARM: dts: imx6qdl-sabresd: enable
 wdog2 instead of wdog1 in ldo-bypass board.

commit dd276519cd272ba52d8620aa14a7a2c88750bf5c from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

As we use WDOG_B pin of wdog2 to reset extenal pmic in ldo-bypass mode, so we need
use WDOG2 as the default watchdog device in kernel.
