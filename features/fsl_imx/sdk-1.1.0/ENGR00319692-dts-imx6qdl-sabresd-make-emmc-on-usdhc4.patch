Subject: [PATCH 0417/1074] ENGR00319692 dts: imx6qdl-sabresd: make emmc on
 usdhc4 fixed to mmc0

The mmc core will reserve the mmc index for the specific controller
by add mmc alias in device tree.
There's an eMMC chip on sabresd board on uSDHC slot 4.
We want it be fixed to mmc0 to be used for finding rootfs persistently.
So adding Alias  mmc0 to usdhc4 in device tree.
