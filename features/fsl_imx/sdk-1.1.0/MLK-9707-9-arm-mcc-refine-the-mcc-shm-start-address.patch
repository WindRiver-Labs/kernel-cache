Subject: [PATCH 0519/1074] MLK-9707-9 arm: mcc: refine the mcc shm start
 address

- in order to compact the DDR memory useage, set the start address
of the mcc share-memory to be 0xbff0_0000 on imx6sx sdb board.
(the upper 1M bytes of the 1G bytes DDR populated on imx6sx sdb board
is enough for MCC in the current implementation.)
- pass the memory size by dts.
