Subject: [PATCH 0235/1074] ENGR00286960-2 arm: imx: improve status check of
 clock gate

For ccm clock gate, both 2b'11 and 2b'01 should be treated
as clock enabled, see below description in CCM:

2b'00: clock is off during all modes;
2b'01: clock is on in run mode, but off in wait and stop mode;
2b'10: Not applicable;
2b'11: clock is on during all modes, except stop mode.
