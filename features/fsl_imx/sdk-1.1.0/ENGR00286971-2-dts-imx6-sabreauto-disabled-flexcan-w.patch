Subject: [PATCH 0231/1074] ENGR00286971-2 dts: imx6-sabreauto: disabled
 flexcan when max7310 is gone

Flexcan transceiver is using GPIOs from max7310 on i2c3.
Since max7310 is gone on below dts files, so there's no reason
to keep flexcan alive in those dts files.

Note: since flexcan1 is disabled by default, so did not need
to add it.
