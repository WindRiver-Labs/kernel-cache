Subject: [PATCH 0244/1074] ENGR00289278 dts: imx6qdl-sabreauto: fix usdhc1
 pin conflict with gpmi

The SD1 on sabreauto baseboard is conflict with gpmi nand. The conflict
pins are DAT4~DAT7. Since the SD3 on cpu board already supports 8 bit bus
width, we do not want add an extra dts file for it, so we disable 8 bit and use
4 bit width for this issue.
