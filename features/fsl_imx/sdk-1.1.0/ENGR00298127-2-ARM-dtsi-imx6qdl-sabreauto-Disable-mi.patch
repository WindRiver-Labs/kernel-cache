Subject: [PATCH 0323/1074] ENGR00298127-2 ARM: dtsi: imx6qdl sabreauto:
 Disable mipi csi

As the sabreauto CPU board schematics mentions, the MIPI connector
isn't mechanically compatible with Freescale MIPI display and camera
board, then we have no way to support MIPI features currently on
this platform.  So, let's disable MIPI CSI.
