Subject: [PATCH 0463/1074] ENGR00327584-1 : ARM: dts: imx6sx: add new ocram
 node for mega/fast save/restore

As when Mega/Fast mix power domain is off in DSM mode, ocram
need to do save/restore for entire space, some of the ocram
space is reserved by low power modules, so to make ocram save/restore
simple, we define a node including total ocram space for DSM
save/restore when mega/fast mix is off.
