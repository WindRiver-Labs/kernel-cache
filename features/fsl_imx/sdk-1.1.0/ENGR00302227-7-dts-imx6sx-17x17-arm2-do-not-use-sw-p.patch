Subject: [PATCH 0306/1074] ENGR00302227-7 dts: imx6sx-17x17-arm2: do not use
 sw polling for card detect

The SW polling for card detect will keep sending command repeatly
at backgroud which will consume CPU MIPS and aslo affects the normal
SD debug when enable CONFIG_MMC_DEBUG.

Just as the board design, we simply treat it as no card detect
support.
