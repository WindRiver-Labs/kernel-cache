Subject: [PATCH 0505/1074] MLK-9758 SD card: hot plug: support SD card hot
 plug for i.MX6SX-ARD board

In i.MX6SX-ARD board, the SD slot's card detect pin has an pull-up resistor,
and this pull-up resister is connect to VGEN1_1V2 which is output from PMIC.
But PMIC default turn off VGEN1_1V2, so the card detect pin is always low level,
can't detect whether the SD card has been inserted.

This patch turn on the VGEN1 in PMIC to supprot SD card hot plug.
