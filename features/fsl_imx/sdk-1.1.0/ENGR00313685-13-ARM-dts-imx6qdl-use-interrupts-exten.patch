Subject: [PATCH 0407/1074] ENGR00313685-13 ARM: dts: imx6qdl: use
 interrupts-extended for fec

commit 454cf8f54d9918c8017f2eee7fb0138927ef2afd upstream.

We need to be able to override interrupts in board file to
workaround a hardware bug for ethernet interrupts
waking the processor by using interrupts-extended.
So, use interrupts-extended here as well.
