Subject: [PATCH 0398/1691] MLK-11357-1 ARM: dts: imx7d: debug uart clk better
 to be from OSC

commit 74f8b416c5ed312014025c8411357759d0a5bfae from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

To achieve low power, debug uart clk should be from OSC, so that
it does NOT need to keep PLL on, especially for low power idle
case.
