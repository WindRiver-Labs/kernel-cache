Subject: [PATCH 0543/1691] MLK-11424: dmaengine: imx-sdma: slave_sg can't work
 after running cyclic

commit a1ce8fa19ecfe511fe31a69754f776ae6590c455 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

After running asrc p2p, then asrc m2m can't work. It is caused by the
sdmac->flags isn't reset after running. then sdma_int_handler go to
wrong branch.
