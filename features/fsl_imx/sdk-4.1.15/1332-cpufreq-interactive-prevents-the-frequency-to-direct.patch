Subject: [PATCH 1332/1691] cpufreq: interactive: prevents the frequency to
 directly raise above the hispeed_freq from a lower frequency.

commit c797804700f81899ffe2bb82823a023863d3d646 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

When the load was below go_hispeed_load, there is a possibility that
choose_freq() would return a frequency which would be higher than the
hispeed_freq. According to the policy we should first jump to the
hispeed_freq, stay there for above_hispeed_delay and then be allowed to
raise higher than that.

Added a check to prevent the frequency to be directly raised to
something higher than the hispeed_freq.
