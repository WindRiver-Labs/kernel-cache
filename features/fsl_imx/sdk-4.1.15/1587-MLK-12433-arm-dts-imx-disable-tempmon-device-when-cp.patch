Subject: [PATCH 1587/1691] MLK-12433: arm: dts: imx: disable tempmon device
 when cpufreq is disabled

commit 54cf6a27e33647c9405b9ba1ae49bb96ceefaa63 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

In the lpddr3-arm2-m4 dts, the I2C1 is disabled, so PMIC is disabled,
the cpufreq is not support. As thermal driver is depended on cpufreq
driver, if cpufreq is not support, the tempmon device can be disabled.
