Subject: [PATCH 14974/88790] freescale: remove incorrect copied comment

commit 1c3b8c2fe71a5052270167a1c5786aaf0d86cf19 upstream

The comment in question is word-for-word copied from ixgbe, and clearly
has no meaning in freescale's driver. (it even says 'return an error'
when the code clearly does not). Remove the comment as it is obviously
incorrect and not applicable to the code as it is today.
