Subject: [PATCH 1588/1691] MLK-12443 ARM: imx: disable low power mode before
 entering LPSR mode

commit 7a11789d1330b54fd916e1db94616f2367d90828 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

Before entering LPSR mode, as GPC was set to STOP/DSM mode already,
the wfi loop after LPSR mode would cause system enter STOP/DSM mode
first, then SNVS will force PMIC_ON_REQ to low, as SNVS needs IPG
clock to be on before entering SNVS/LPSR mode, so we have to disable
STOP/DSM mode to make sure IPG clock is on before SNVS actually enters
LPSR mode.
