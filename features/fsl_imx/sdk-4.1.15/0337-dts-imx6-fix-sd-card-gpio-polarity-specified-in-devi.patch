Subject: [PATCH 0337/1691] dts: imx6qdl: fix sd card gpio polarity specified in
 device tree

commit b650c1a0846410e4b0e01f76bebe7c9313ee136a from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

cd-gpios polarity should be changed to GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW and wp-gpios
should be changed to GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH.
Otherwise, the SD may not work properly due to wrong polarity inversion
specified in DT after switch to common parsing function mmc_of_parse().
