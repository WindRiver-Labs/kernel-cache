Subject: [PATCH 0961/1691] MLK-11758 dts: mx6ul evk: set regulator wlreg_on
 always on

commit e6bd4673d7df83cd8a1fc678ba71fc0132788d9f from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

Murata adapter VDDIO is derived from sd slot VMMC supply, if usdhc cannot
detect sd/sdio card, VMMC is shutdown that causes VDDIO has no voltage, and
bt cannot work. So BT depends on VDDIO/VMMC.

Now the workaround is set wlreg_on alwasys on, usdhc can detect wifi card
and supply VMMC 3.3V voltage, so that Murata adapter VDDIO has power supply.
