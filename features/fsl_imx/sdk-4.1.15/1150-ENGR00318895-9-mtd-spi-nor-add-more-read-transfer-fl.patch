Subject: [PATCH 1150/1691] ENGR00318895-9: mtd: spi-nor: add more read
 transfer flags for n25q256a

commit 9260e59380782a90631df1136bde32dab01a0351 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

The NOR flash can supports dual/quad/ddr-quad read.
Add more flags for these read transfers.

From the datasheet, the chip support the 64K sector erase operation.
So remove the SECT_4K for the chip which makes the flash_erase faster.
