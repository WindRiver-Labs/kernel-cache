Subject: [PATCH 0645/1691] MLK-11479-05 ASoC: fsl: Fix set-mute-failed issue
 after WM8962 capture

commit d1f0442cde3c594a7f561a910a0930f472a81b7c from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

cherry-pick below patch from v3.14.y:
ENGR00277471 ASoC: fsl: Fix set-mute-failed issue after WM8962 capture

We only need to mute WM8962 after playback, so add direction check
before doing mute.

And a mute failure would cause hw_free() abruptly return after it,
which might drop the essential procedure code for FLL controlling.
Thus put mute before FLL controlling code and drop its return check.
