Subject: [PATCH 0264/1691] MLK-10051-1 usb: host: don't break clear suspend
 feature if otg fsm is used

commit 6dc06d05ed11f38374cfebf5c1a5b87832b4213c from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

Current code just do not do reusme signaling for clear suspend feature if it's
a OTG port with b_hnp_enable set, this result in OTG host cannot clear suspend
and resume OTG device after system resume from sleep, then host will disconnect
the OTG B-device and enumerate it again. To make OTG A-device in host state can
do clear feature of suspend like an usual host, and also be compatible legacy
OTG device, this patch adds another condition to check if OTG FSM driver is used
,as in OTG FSM driver, we need not do HNP in that case.
