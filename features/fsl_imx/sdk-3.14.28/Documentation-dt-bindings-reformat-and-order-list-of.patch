Subject: [PATCH 0497/1543] Documentation: dt-bindings: reformat and order
 list of ahci-platform compatibles

commit 5799d6d4cf86c11503aee909a1ec555453c7f22a upstream

The ahci-platform.txt Device Tree binding documentation is gaining a
growing number of compatible strings, and it will gain one more with
the addition of the Marvell Armada 380 AHCI support. It is therefore
time to reformat this list into a proper bullet list, and more
importantly order it alphabetically;
