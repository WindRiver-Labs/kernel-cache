Subject: [PATCH 0489/1543] libata: make AHCI_XGENE depend on PHY_XGENE

commit 74c03eb63061c834893e7ebf8d298573bdccfd08 upstream

AHCI_XGENE is only applicable on ARM64 but it can also be enabled for
compile testing; however, AHCI_XGENE selects PHY_XGENE which has other
arch specific dependencies.  This leads to the following warning when
enabling it on other archs for compile testing.

  warning: (AHCI_XGENE) selects PHY_XGENE which has unmet direct
  dependencies (HAS_IOMEM && OF && (ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST))

Selecting a config option which itself has dependencies can easily
lead to broken configurations.  For now, let's just make AHCI_XGENE
depend on PHY_XGENE which has all the necessary dependencies already.
