Subject: [PATCH 1117/1543] ENGR00286273-3 arm: dtsi: imx6sl: add iram
 property to support internal SRAM

commit 379aa10765a89b5a7f77adf34ca2ead93ecf7e9a from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

By doing this, we can allow SDMA driver to allocate its memory from iram
when using i.MX6 SoloLite SoC.

(cherry picked from commit aa527b38d52af233641edc500acae0e6212ccdb3)
