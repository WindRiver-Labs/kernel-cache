Subject: [PATCH 0142/1543] mtd: spi-nor: unify read opcode variants with ST
 SPI FSM

commit 58b89a1f4c2a65b10b8f7b90b6ff2161b19bb0d1 upstream

serial_flash_cmds.h defines our opcodes a little differently. Let's
borrow its naming, since it's borrowed from the SFDP standard, and it's
more extensible.

This prepares us for merging serial_flash_cmds.h and spi-nor.h opcode
listing.
