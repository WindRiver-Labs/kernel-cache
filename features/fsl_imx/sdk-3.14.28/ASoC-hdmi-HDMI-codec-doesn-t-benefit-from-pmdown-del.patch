Subject: [PATCH 1059/1543] ASoC: hdmi: HDMI codec doesn't benefit from pmdown
 delay

commit 69434097916bc52a4d6d495a0d719eb02e0cff9e upstream

Adds .ignore_pmdown_time = true to codec driver struct.

HDMI codec is currently a dummy codec and doesn't benefit from pmdown
delay. Even if in the future the codec would controll HDMI encoder, it
would still be a digital to digital interface that should have no need
for pmdown delay.
