Subject: [PATCH 1530/1543] MLK-10228 dts: imx6qdl-sabreauto: remove SDb WP
 pin which is not connect by default

commit 7ef864bb464996bb2e36db31efbab2b4f742fcb1 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

SDb WP pin is not connected by default on MX6Q CPU2 board, so we removed it
in DTS file. BTW, SDb slot is designed for WiFi slot, it is ok to disable WP
for old CPU board also.
