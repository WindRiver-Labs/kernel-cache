Subject: [PATCH 1229/1543] usb: chipidea: fix phy handling

commit 21a5b579cb63364b90e545e7e0a4bccb027711e8 upstream

The generic plaftorm device for ChipIdea drivers is probed by calling
ci_hdrc_probe. The device structure used is not the one of the specific
ChipIdea driver but the one of the generic ChipIdea platform device.

This results in not being able to probe the PHYs as we're not using the
right device structure. Since all ChipIdea drivers are retrieving their
PHYs in their specific driver code, this didn't impact any of them yet.

Fixes it using the right device structure (dev->parent).
