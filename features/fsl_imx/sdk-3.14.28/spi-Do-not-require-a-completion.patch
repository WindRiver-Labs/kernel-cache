Subject: [PATCH 1171/1543] spi: Do not require a completion

commit 1e25cd4729bd76662d02b142a6a7f8504bb6aea7 upstream

There is no real reason why we require transfers to have a completion and
the only user of the completion now checks to see if one has been provided
before using it so stop enforcing this. This makes it more convenient for
drivers to chain multiple asynchronous transfers together.
