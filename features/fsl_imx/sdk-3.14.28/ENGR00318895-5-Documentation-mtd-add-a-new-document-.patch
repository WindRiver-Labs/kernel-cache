Subject: [PATCH 0287/1543] ENGR00318895-5 Documentation: mtd: add a new
 document for SPI NOR flash

commit 2aa6a1231fe9bc8e5bba8a449f74ab20286503e3 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

We need a DT property to store the dummy cycles for DDR Quad read.
This is a common feature for the SPI NOR flash, such as Spansion and Micron
chips.

Add this file to describe this specific SPI NOR flash features which will
be referred by the SPI NOR flash drivers.

+This file defines some DT properties for specific SPI NOR flash features.
+The SPI NOR controller drivers may refer to this file, such as fsl-quadspi.txt

+Optional properties:
+  - spi-nor,ddr-quad-read-dummy: The dummy cycles used by the DDR Quad read.
+                                 Please refer to the chip's datasheet. This
+                                 property can be 4 or 6 which is less then 8.
