Subject: [PATCH 0651/1543] ENGR00331450-4: ARM: dts: imx6q/dl: add ldo-bypass
 support

commit dbdd671c35790128684e233743a3bd9f92292f0f from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

Add ldo-bypass support on imx6q/dl. Currently, we use ldo-bypass
mode on imx6qdl-sabresd board, and ldo-enabled mode on imx6dl-sabre
auto board.
