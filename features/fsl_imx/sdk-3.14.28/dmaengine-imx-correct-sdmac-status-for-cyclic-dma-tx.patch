Subject: [PATCH 1120/1543] dmaengine: imx: correct sdmac->status for cyclic
 dma tx

commit ffe59b29308791c9600ab86de2ca070d742c107d upstream

In cyclic dma tx's handler sdma_handle_channel_loop(),
SDMA channel statue is set to either DMA_ERROR or DMA_IN_PROGRESS
based on each period's status. This has the following issues:

1) If one period's status is BD_RROR, then channel status
   will be set to DMA_ERROR, but it will be overwritten to DMA_IN_PROGRESS
   if the following periods are OK.
2) DMA client may call sdma_control(DMA_TERMINATE_ALL) to stop the cyclic dma
   operation, sdma channel status will be set to DMA_ERROR,
   but if after this handler is called, then again the channel status will be overwritten
   to DMA_IN_PROGRESS. Then the following dmaengine_prep_dma_cyclic() will always fail,
   as channel status is DMA_IN_PROGRESS.

As in cyclic dma tx, channel status will be initially set to DMA_IN_PROGRESS,
driver only needs to change it to DMA_ERROR, when something wrong happens
(one period status is wrong, or stoped by client explicitly).
