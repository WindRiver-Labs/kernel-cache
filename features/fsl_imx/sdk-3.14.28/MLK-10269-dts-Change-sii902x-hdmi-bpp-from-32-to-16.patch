Subject: [PATCH 1534/1543] MLK-10269: dts: Change sii902x hdmi bpp from 32 to
 16

commit 9bbfe34b9bc4146c8aa74144e89e8a20ccd1fa5c from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

In imx6sl/sx dts, the lcdif display bpp is setting to 16,
and sii902x hdmi driver bpp is 32.
The sii902x driver will overwrite the display bpp when it loading,
but some module such as v4l2 output driver is misses bpp change event.
So align sii902x hdmi driver bpp with lcdif display bpp.
