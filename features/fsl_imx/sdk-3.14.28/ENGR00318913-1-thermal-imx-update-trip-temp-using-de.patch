Subject: [PATCH 0298/1543] ENGR00318913-1 thermal: imx: update trip temp
 using default setting

commit c0f56c0cd796eeeafadee0b2c792256f771dfcff from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

Previously, the critical and passive trip temp settings are from
calibration data of hot point, but the lastest chips are only
calibrated at 25C and use an universal formula to get real temp,
so there is no longer a hot point value in calibration data, need
to set the critical and passive trip temp manually instead of
getting them from calibration data.

Currently the default setting for passive trip temp is 85 C, and
critical trip temp is 20 C higher than passive trip temp, which
is 105 C.
