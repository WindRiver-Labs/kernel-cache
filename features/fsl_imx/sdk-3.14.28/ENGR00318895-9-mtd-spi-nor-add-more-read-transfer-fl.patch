Subject: [PATCH 0291/1543] ENGR00318895-9 mtd: spi-nor: add more read
 transfer flags for n25q256a

commit 8f4e9e58fb3e46fd75feee98d3a1e2575a468000 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

The NOR flash can supports dual/quad/ddr-quad read.
Add more flags for these read transfers.

From the datasheet, the chip support the 64K sector erase operation.
So remove the SECT_4K for the chip which makes the flash_erase faster.
