-The SPI bus controller only deals with the byte stream.
-Some controller does not works like a SPI bus controller, it works
-like a SPI NOR controller instead, such as the Freescale's QuadSPI controller.
+SPI bus controllers (drivers/spi/) only deal with streams of bytes; the bus
+controller operates agnostic of the specific device attached. However, some
+controllers (such as Freescale's QuadSPI controller) cannot easily handle
+arbitrary streams of bytes, but rather are designed specifically for SPI NOR.
 
-The Freescale's QuadSPI controller should know the NOR commands to
-find the right LUT sequence. Unfortunately, the old code can not meet
-this requirement.
+In particular, Freescale's QuadSPI controller must know the NOR commands to
+find the right LUT sequence. Unfortunately, the SPI subsystem has no notion of
+opcodes, addresses, or data payloads; a SPI controller simply knows to send or
+receive bytes (Tx and Rx). Therefore, we must define a new layering scheme under
+which the controller driver is aware of the opcodes, addressing, and other
+details of the SPI NOR protocol.
 
 Part II - How does the framework work?

 With this new layer, the SPI NOR controller driver does not depend on the
