Subject: [PATCH 0078/1543] ENGR00317981: drm: set drm_device pointer into
 drvdata

commit 218d73dde2820116478c77f3d4298fdca2ea94b7 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

If drvdata is not used by platform driver, let's set drm_device
pointer into it.  We take this as the default usage of drvdata,
and platform driver is free to overwrite it later as needed.
