Subject: [PATCH 0285/1543] ENGR00318895-3 mtd: spi-nor: add a new field for
 spi_nor{}

commit ac055db7d615ea8bac88003c4f7d72e95e28e032 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

We need the SPI NOR child node to store some specific features, such as the
dummy cycles for the DDR Quad read.

But now, we only have the @dev field in the spi_nor{}. The @dev may points to a
spi_device{} for m25p80, while it may points to a platform_deivice{} for the
SPI NOR controller, such as fsl_quadspi.c.

It is not convenient for us to get come information from the SPI NOR flash.

This patch adds a new field @np to spi_nor{}, it points to the child node for
the SPI NOR flash.
