Subject: [PATCH 0260/1543] ASoC: fsl_ssi: Add suspend/resume support

commit b20e53a826a7adc3bfd2772bd49a83b6f21b4cce upstream

Doing a suspend/resume sequence while playing an audio track in the backgroung
causes broken audio right after resume:

root@freescale /$ aplay clarinet.wav &

root@freescale /home$ Playing WAVE 'clarinet.wav' : Signed 16 bit Little Endian,
 Rate 44100 Hz, Mono

root@freescale /home$ echo mem > /sys/power/state
PM: Syncing filesystems ... done.

Suspending console(s) (use no_console_suspend to debug)
PM: suspend of devices complete after 37.082 msecs

PM: early resume of devices complete after 4.000 msecs
PM: resume of devices complete after 68.907 msecs
PM: resume devices took 0.070 seconds

Add SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_RESUME/SUSPEND cases so that we can gracefully handle
system suspend/resume.
