Subject: [PATCH 1386/1543] MLK-9871 dts: imx6sx: remove canfd related stuff

commit d0bbee1ee39b9e5ab8f66c925ce132b60909b3d7 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

The CANFD IP will be removed in final production, so remove
the CANFD related stuff in dts tree to avoid confusion.
The patch only removed user level in dts part, the exists related
clocks and pads in source code are still there which seems not matter.
