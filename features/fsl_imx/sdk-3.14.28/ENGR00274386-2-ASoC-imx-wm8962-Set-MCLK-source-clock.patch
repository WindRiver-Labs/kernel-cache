Subject: [PATCH 0670/1543] ENGR00274386-2 ASoC: imx-wm8962: Set MCLK source
 clock to 0Hz in hw_free()

commit b860c3b2a3bddebc6292126fe834da6f8eaaaa26 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

When DAPM closed WM8962 after playback, its driver would prompt
'wm8962 0-001a: Unsupported sysclk ratio 500' due to the invalid
divisor calculated by WM8962 codec driver.

To fix it, we can work around by setting its MCLK source to 0Hz,
so the codec driver would never get an invalid divisor any more.
Since hw_params() would re-set the MCLK source, no need to worry
about any side-effect.
