Subject: [PATCH 0030/1543] ARM: dts: imx6q: add vddsoc/pu setpoint info

commit 69171eda49ae6c620bffa17204750e8dc6060357 upstream

i.MX6Q needs to update vddarm, vddsoc/pu regulators when cpu freq
is changed, each setpoint has different voltage, so we need to
pass vddarm, vddsoc/pu's freq-voltage info from dts together.
