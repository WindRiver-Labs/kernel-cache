Subject: [PATCH 0871/1543] ethtool: Fix unwanted section breaks in kernel-doc

commit 073e3cf21916afa25c1f3e8807a8ebf4faf6f4d5 upstream

A colon almost unavoidably starts a new section.  The script should be
changed to provide a way to avoid this, but for now reword the
comments to avoid using colons.
