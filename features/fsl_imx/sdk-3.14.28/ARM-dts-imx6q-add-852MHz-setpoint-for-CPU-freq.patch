Subject: [PATCH 0031/1543] ARM: dts: imx6q: add 852MHz setpoint for CPU freq

commit 89ef8ef45e96a784fc41768f73af12c965933935 upstream

According to datasheet, i.MX6Q has setpoint of 852MHz
which is exclusive with 996MHz, the fuse map of speed_grading
defines the max speed of ARM, here we add this 852MHz
setpoint opp info, kernel will check the speed_grading
fuse and remove all illegal setpoints.
