Subject: [PATCH 0919/1543] MLK-9704 videobuf-dma-contig: set vm_pgoff to be
 zero to pass the sanity check in
 vm_iomap_memory().

commit 65ce75f475c3e18c557c7ec0b53a7c3cceaa54cf from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git

When user requests V4L2_MEMORY_MMAP type buffers, the videobuf-core
will assign the corresponding offset to the 'boff' field of the
videobuf_buffer for each requested buffer sequentially. Later, user
may call mmap() to map one or all of the buffers with the 'offset'
parameter which is equal to its 'boff' value. Obviously, the 'offset'
value is only used to find the matched buffer instead of to be the
real offset from the buffer's physical start address as used by
vm_iomap_memory(). So, in some case that if the offset is not zero,
vm_iomap_memory() will fail.
