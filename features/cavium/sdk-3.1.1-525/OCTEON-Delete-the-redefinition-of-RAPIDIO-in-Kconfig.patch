Subject: [PATCH 3/3] OCTEON: Delete the redefinition of RAPIDIO in Kconfig

There is a compile warning about RAPIDIO:
    warning: ignoring type redefinition of 'RAPIDIO' from 'boolean' to 'tristate'

The RAPIDIO config has been defined in arch/mips/Kconfig, so it is no need to
redefine it in octeon Kconfig, and delete it from octeon Kconfig.
