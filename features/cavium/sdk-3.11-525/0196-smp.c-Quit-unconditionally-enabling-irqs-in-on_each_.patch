Subject: [PATCH 196/518] smp.c: Quit unconditionally enabling irqs in
 on_each_cpu_mask().

Source: Cavium Networks, Inc.
MR: 00000
Type: Integration
Disposition: Merged from Octeon Tree
ChangeID: e4b385697a051f8f0c2874b34950348a01701481
Description:

As in f21afc25f9ed (smp.h: Use local_irq_{save,restore}() in !SMP
version of on_each_cpu().), we don't want to enable irqs if they are
not already enabled.

I don't know of any bugs currently caused by this unconditional
local_irq_enable(), but I want to use this function in MIPS/OCTEON
early boot (when we have early_boot_irqs_disabled).  This also makes
this function have similar semantics to on_each_cpu() which is good in
itself.
