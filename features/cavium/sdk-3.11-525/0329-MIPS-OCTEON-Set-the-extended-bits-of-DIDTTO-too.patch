Subject: [PATCH 329/518] MIPS: OCTEON: Set the extended bits of DIDTTO too.

Source: Cavium Networks, Inc.
MR: 00000
Type: Integration
Disposition: Merged from Octeon Tree
ChangeID: f1b87aad4c74418d5ec6aecd46e1316f7062a78a
Description:

The field was expanded and made disjoint.  Set both parts.  On old
chips this is reserved as zero, so it works there too.
