Subject: [PATCH 191/518] MIPS: Move system level config items from
 CPU_CAVIUM_OCTEON to CAVIUM_OCTEON_SOC

Source: Cavium Networks, Inc.
MR: 00000
Type: Integration
Disposition: Merged from Octeon Tree
ChangeID: 486aac7ea20398b53e26b5fd02bef7f671ad28d5
Description:

They are a property of the SoC not the CPU itself.  Also get rid of
CPU_SUPPORTS_HIGHMEM as it doesn't support a 32-bit kernel and HIGHMEM
is untested and usless on 64-bit kernels.

Update the help text to be more factual.

-	  This option supports all of the Octeon reference boards from Cavium

-		EBH3000
-		EBH3100
-		Thunder
-		Kodama

 	  Say Y here for most Octeon reference boards.
