Subject: [PATCH 675/974] MIPS: octeon-ethernet: remove hard-coded pool count

Eliminate explicitly-sized cvm_oct_pools[], sizing it to
[CVMX_FPA1_NUM_POOLS+1] to provide resilience against off-by-one.

This was causing hang when CVMX_FPA1_NUM_POOLS was upped to 9 in 8806baadfe,
which still seems to occur on cn70 after it was reduced to 8.
[Original patch taken from Cavium SDK 3.1.2-568]
