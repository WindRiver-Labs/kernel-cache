Subject: [PATCH 948/974] mtd: m25p80: Fix 4 byte addressing mode for Micron
 devices.

According to the datasheet for Micron n25q256a (N25Q256A13ESF40F) 4-byte
addressing mode should be entered as follows:

<quote>
To enter or exit the 4-byte address mode, the WRITE ENABLE command
must be executed to set the write enable latch bit to 1. (Note: The
WRITE ENABLE command must NOT be executed on the N25Q256A83ESF40x and
N25Q256A83E1240x devices.) S# must be driven LOW. The effect of the
command is immediate; after the command has been executed, the write
enable latch bit is cleared to 0.
</quote>

Micron's portable way to perform this for all types of Micron flash
is to first issue a write enable, then switch the addressing mode
followed by a write disable to avoid leaving the flash in a write-
able state.
