Subject: [PATCH 217/382] MIPS: Move system level config items from CPU_CAVIUM_OCTEON to CAVIUM_OCTEON_SOC

Based on SDK octeon3_3.10.

They are a property of the SoC not the CPU itself.  Also get rid of
CPU_SUPPORTS_HIGHMEM as it doesn't support a 32-bit kernel and HIGHMEM
is untested and usless on 64-bit kernels.

Update the help text to be more factual.
