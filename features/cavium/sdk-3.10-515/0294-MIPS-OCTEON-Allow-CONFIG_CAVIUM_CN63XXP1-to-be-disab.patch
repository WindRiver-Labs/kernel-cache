Subject: [PATCH 294/382] MIPS: OCTEON: Allow CONFIG_CAVIUM_CN63XXP1 to be disabled.

Based on SDK octeon3_3.10.

It is advantageous to use CONFIG_CAVIUM_OCTEON2 with OCTEON III CPU
cores as they have the same instruction set.  However, OCTEON III
doesn't require the CN63XXP1 workaround, so make it optional.
