Subject: [PATCH 192/291] i40e: Fix dangling ring pointers upon driver removal

commit 70114ec4aa38096253eef8a9379a59d129e90902 upstream

When we resize the number of queues, the driver needs to disassociate any
qvectors that are no longer in use from the original rings, this way we
do not try to access the rings through these qvectors at the time of freeing
the qvectors.
