Subject: [RT PATCH v3 1/2] RT: Remove comment that is no longer true

    [ The following text is in the "utf-8" character set. ]
    [ Your display is set for the "ANSI_X3.4-1968" character set.  ]
    [ Some characters may be displayed incorrectly. ]

We fixed the condition noted in the comment with the "pushable_tasks"
logic, but forgot to remove this comment.  Lets clean it up.
