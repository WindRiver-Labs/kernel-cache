  don't trace early init functions for ppc32

  If the latency tracer is turned on in the kernel config, _mcount calls are
  added automatically to every function call during compiling since -pg
  compiling flag is set. _mcount() checks first the variable mcount_enabled.
  (see implementation of _mcount() in arch/powerpc/kernel/entry_32.S) This will
  stuck forever if _mcount is called before mcount_enabled is initialized. Hence
  we mark some init functions as notrace, so that _mcount calls are not added to
  these functions.
