Premmpt-RT: Preevent boosting of idle task

Idle task boosting is a nono in general. There is one
exception, when NOHZ is active:

The idle task calls get_next_timer_interrupt() and holds
the timer wheel base->lock on the CPU and another CPU wants
to access the timer (probably to cancel it). We can safely
ignore the boosting request, as the idle CPU runs this code
with interrupts disabled and will complete the lock
protected section without being interrupted. So there is no
real need to boost.
