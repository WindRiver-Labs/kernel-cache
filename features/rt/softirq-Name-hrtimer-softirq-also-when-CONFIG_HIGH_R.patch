Subject: [PATCH] softirq: Name hrtimer softirq also when CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=n

commit d2638539b55c202e07deb4730cd8620174c757e8 in tip.

Remy Bohmer pointed out that we create the hrtimer softirq thread even
when CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS is off. That results in a softirq-NULL
name for the thread. The thread is needed on -rt
