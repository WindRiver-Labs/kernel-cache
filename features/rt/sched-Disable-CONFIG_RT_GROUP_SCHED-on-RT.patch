Subject: [PATCH] sched: Disable CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED on RT

Carsten reported problems when running:

	taskset 01 chrt -f 1 sleep 1

from within rc.local on a F15 machine. The task stays running and
never gets on the run queue because some of the run queues have
rt_throttled=1 which does not go away. Works nice from a ssh login
shell. Disabling CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED solves that as well.
