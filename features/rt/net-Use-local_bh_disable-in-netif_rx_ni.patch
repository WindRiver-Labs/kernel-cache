Subject: [PATCH] net: Use local_bh_disable in netif_rx_ni()

This code triggers the new WARN in __raise_softirq_irqsoff() though it
actually looks at the softirq pending bit and calls into the softirq
code, but that fits not well with the context related softirq model of
RT. It's correct on mainline though, but going through
local_bh_disable/enable here is not going to hurt badly.
