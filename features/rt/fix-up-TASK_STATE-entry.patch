Subject: [PATCH] fix up TASK_STATE entry

This is one of several extractions from the merge up to 33-rc8.

You can find the origin of this change in the tip merge commit:

     commit 5f854cfc024622e4aae14d7cf422f6ff86278688
     Merge: cc24da0 4ec62b2
     Author: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>
     Date:   Sun Feb 21 20:17:22 2010 +0100

         Forward to 2.6.33-rc8

         Merge branch 'linus' into rt/head with a pile of conflicts.

         Signed-off-by: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>

Normally there are not significant changes/additions in a merge commit that
are not from any other "normal" commit.  But in this case there are, so
break them out into separate explicit commits.
