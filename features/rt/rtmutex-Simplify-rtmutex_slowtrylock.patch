Subject: [PATCH] rtmutex: Simplify rtmutex_slowtrylock()

upstream-commit: 88f2b4c15e561bb5c28709d666364f273bf54b98

Oleg noticed that rtmutex_slowtrylock() has a pointless check for
rt_mutex_owner(lock) != current.

To avoid calling try_to_take_rtmutex() we really want to check whether
the lock has an owner at all or whether the trylock failed because the
owner is NULL, but the RT_MUTEX_HAS_WAITERS bit is set. This covers
the lock is owned by caller situation as well.

We can actually do this check lockless. trylock is taking a chance
whether we take lock->wait_lock to do the check or not.

Add comments to the function while at it.
