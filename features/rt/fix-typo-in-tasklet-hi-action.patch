Subject: [LAU] [PATCH] [RT] tasklets: fix typo in tasklet_hi_action
Date: Sun, 4 Jan 2009 15:20:58 +0000

[l-a-u CCed because we've been talking about this problem there
recently, and that's what prodded me to do the bisection to track it
down... fortunately the -rt8 to -rt9 interdiff was pretty small!]

Subject: [PATCH] [RT] tasklets: fix typo in tasklet_hi_action

Fix a typo in tasklet_hi_action -- using the wrong tasklet list when removing
actions.

This appears to be what was causing the ALSA sequencer device not to work in
2.6.26 with the RT patch: the sequencer was flaky in -rt1 to -rt8, and just
hung in -rt9 and later, after tasklets-fix-tasklet_hi_schedule.patch which
fixed the same typo when adding to the list. I guess that's because before -rt9
the actions were going onto the wrong list, whereas after -rt9 they were being
lost entirely once the first one had been performed. It seems happy now,
anyway.
