Subject: [PATCH 1/5] optimize rt lock wakeup

    [ The following text is in the "utf-8" character set. ]
    [ Your display is set for the "iso-8859-1" character set.  ]
    [ Some characters may be displayed incorrectly. ]

It is redundant to wake the grantee task if it is already running, and 
the call to wake_up_process is relatively expensive.  If we can safely
skip it we can measurably improve the performance of the adaptive-locks.

Credit goes to Peter Morreale for the general idea.
