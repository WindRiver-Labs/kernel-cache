   Subject: [PREEMPT RT] SLUB and split softirq lock for v3.4-rt
   Date: Wed, 13 Feb 2013 17:13:39 +0100
   Message-ID: <1360772031-27186-1-git-send-email-bigeasy@linutronix.de>
   
   3.4-rt which lacks two RT features from 3.6: SLUB support and the
   split softirq lock implementation.
   
   SLUB has a way better performance than SLAB on RT and the split
   softirq lock implementation is necessary especially for realtime
   networking applications.
   
   The following patch series backports these features to 3.4-rt.
   
   Steven, could you please apply these patches to a separate
   3.4-rt-features branch?
