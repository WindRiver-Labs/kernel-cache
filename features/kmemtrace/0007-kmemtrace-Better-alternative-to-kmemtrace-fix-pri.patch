Subject: [PATCH] kmemtrace: Better alternative to "kmemtrace: fix printk format warnings".

Fix the problem "kmemtrace: fix printk format warnings" attempted to fix,
but resulted in marker-probe format mismatch warnings. Instead of carrying
size_t into probes, we get rid of it by casting to unsigned long, just as
we did with gfp_t.

This way, we don't need to change marker format strings and we don't have
to rely on other format specifiers like "%zu", making for consistent use
of more generic data types (since there are no format specifiers for
gfp_t, for example).
