This feature is intended to assist in the testing of
the threaded interrupt model present in 2.6.30+ kernels.
Drivers are slowly being converted, however, there are few
at the moment leaving it hard to actually test this kernel
feature (unless you have one of the devices already switched
over). By converting USB over to threaded interrupts we now
have something more broadly available to test this feature.
