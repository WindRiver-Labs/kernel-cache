The consumer kernel features are only used by Platform
For Consumer Devices.

These feature templates are used to create custom, scaled
versions of the kernel for small consumer devices.

Each feature template contains its own kernel config fragment
in the file <feature>.cfg. The total.scc file combines all of
the features into a single configuration.

To use these feature templates together, you have configure with
--enable-kernel=small+features/consumer/total.scc

To use a certain feature template, you have configure with
--enable-kernel=small+features/consumer/<feature>.scc

All of these features are not enabled by default.
