Subject: [PATCH] mm: introduce a common interface for balloon pages mobility

commit 18468d93e53b037e1a04ec58398eab763d054064 upstream.

Memory fragmentation introduced by ballooning might reduce significantly
the number of 2MB contiguous memory blocks that can be used within a guest,
thus imposing performance penalties associated with the reduced number of
transparent huge pages that could be used by the guest workload.

This patch introduces a common interface to help a balloon driver on
making its page set movable to compaction, and thus allowing the system
to better leverage the compation efforts on memory defragmentation.

+/*
+ * include/linux/balloon_compaction.h
+ *
+ * Common interface definitions for making balloon pages movable by compaction.
+ *
+ * Despite being perfectly possible to perform ballooned pages migration, they
+ * make a special corner case to compaction scans because balloon pages are not
+ * enlisted at any LRU list like the other pages we do compact / migrate.
+ *
+ * As the page isolation scanning step a compaction thread does is a lockless
+ * procedure (from a page standpoint), it might bring some racy situations while
+ * performing balloon page compaction. In order to sort out these racy scenarios
+ * and safely perform balloon's page compaction and migration we must, always,
+ * ensure following these three simple rules:
+ *
+ *   i. when updating a balloon's page ->mapping element, strictly do it under
+ *      the following lock order, independently of the far superior
+ *      locking scheme (lru_lock, balloon_lock):
+ *	    +-page_lock(page);
+ *	      +--spin_lock_irq(&b_dev_info->pages_lock);
+ *	            ... page->mapping updates here ...
+ *
+ *  ii. before isolating or dequeueing a balloon page from the balloon device
+ *      pages list, the page reference counter must be raised by one and the
+ *      extra refcount must be dropped when the page is enqueued back into
+ *      the balloon device page list, thus a balloon page keeps its reference
+ *      counter raised only while it is under our special handling;
+ *
+ * iii. after the lockless scan step have selected a potential balloon page for
+ *      isolation, re-test the page->mapping flags and the page ref counter
+ *      under the proper page lock, to ensure isolating a valid balloon page
+ *      (not yet isolated, nor under release procedure)
+ *
+ * The functions provided by this interface are placed to help on coping with
+ * the aforementioned balloon page corner case, as well as to ensure the simple
+ * set of exposed rules are satisfied while we are dealing with balloon pages
+ * compaction / migration.
