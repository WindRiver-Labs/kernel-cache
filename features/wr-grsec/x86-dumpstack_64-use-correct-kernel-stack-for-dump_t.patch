Subject: [PATCH 2/3] x86/dumpstack_64: use correct kernel stack for dump_trace

The previous patch "oprofile: grsecurity changes results in x86-64 page fault"
erroneously makes the dump_trace to use thread_info of a task as kernel
stack base to walking the stack, this further causes empty stack trace dumpped
by dump_stack called from a kernel module, because the thread_info is moved off
the kernel stack in Pax and it does not point to the kernel stack anymore.

Call task_stack_page to get the stack of the current task of which stack is
dummped.
