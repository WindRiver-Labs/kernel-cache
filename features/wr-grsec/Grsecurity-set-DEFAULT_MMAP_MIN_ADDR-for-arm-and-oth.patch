Subject: [PATCH 1/3] Grsecurity: set DEFAULT_MMAP_MIN_ADDR for arm and other
 archs

vm.mmap_min_addr = max(DEFAULT_MMAP_MIN_ADDR, LSM_MMAP_MIN_ADDR).

Because LSM_MMAP_MIN_ADDR is set to 32768-65536 depend on archs, and
grsecurity's patch set DEFAULT_MMAP_MIN_ADDR to 65536 will cause
vm.mmap_min_addr always be 65536.

This will result in many userspace applications fail to execute and
normal user could not login in, on ARM or some other targets.

  # strace -p $LOGIN_PID
  [pid  3146] execve("/bin/sh", ["-sh"], [/* 8 vars */] <unfinished ...>
  [pid  3146] +++ killed by SIGKILL +++
