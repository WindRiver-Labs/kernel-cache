Subject: [PATCH 245/390] powerpc-fix-trace-clock-header

[PATCH] lttng: powerpc trace-clock.h include <asm/time.h> for get_tbl

Make get_tbl() and get_tb() known to powerpc <asm/trace-clock.h> by
having it include <asm/time.h> (where get_tbl() and get_tb() are defined).

This fixes compiler errors when get_tbl() and get_tb() were referenced
by <asm/trace-clock.h> without being defined.

On the other hand, <asm/processor.h> was needlessly included.  Remove it.
