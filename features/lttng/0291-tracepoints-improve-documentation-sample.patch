Subject: [PATCH 291/391] tracepoints-improve-documentation-sample

After reading the tracepoints.txt documentation, I tried to
follow the instructions to run the sample, but just assigning
CONFIG_SAMPLE_TRACEPOINTS=m wasn't enough to generate the tracepoints
samples. I also need to set CONFIG_SAMPLES=y, otherwise nothing
happens.

So, this silly patch explicit says that CONFIG_SAMPLES should be set to
compile those files.
