Subject: [PATCH 240/391] lttng-relay-lockless-remove-wmb-from-fast-path

LTTng relay lockless remove wmb from fast path

We can use a remote wmb to speed up fast path by promoting a compiler barrier
into a full smp_wmb() when the reader needs it.

Should increase speed of architectures with out-of-order stores.
