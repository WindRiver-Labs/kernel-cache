Markers Support for Proprierary Modules

There seems to be good arguments for markers to support proprierary modules. So
I am throwing this one-liner in and let's see how people react. It only makes
sure that a module that has been "forced" to be loaded won't have its markers
used. It is important to leave this check to make sure the kernel does not crash
by expecting the markers part of the struct module by mistake in the case there
is an incorrect checksum.


Discussion so far :

                      mod->markers + mod->num_markers, NULL, NULL);
#endif

Is this an attempt to not set a marker for proprietary modules? [...]

On my part, its mostly a matter of not crashing the kernel when someone
tries to force modprobe of a proprietary module (where the checksums
doesn't match) on a kernel that supports the markers. Not doing so
causes the markers to try to find the marker-specific information in
struct module which doesn't exist and OOPSes.

Christoph's point of view is rather more drastic than mine : it's not
interesting for the kernel community to help proprietary modules writers,
so it's a good idea not to give them marker support. (I CC'ed him so he
can clarify his position).

Another way of looking at this though is that by allowing/encouraging
proprietary module writers to include markers, we and their users get
new diagnostic capabilities.  It constitutes a little bit of opening
up, which IMO we should reward rather than punish.

Amen, brother. Been there, done that, got the tshirt (not on Linux, but
other operating systems).

The proprietary module writer has the *source* for the kernel and their module.
There's no way you can prevent the proprietary module writers from using this
feature as long as you allow other module writers to use it.

The biggest complaint against proprietary modules is that they make it
impossible for *us* to debug.  And you want to argue *against* a feature that
would allow them to develop better code that causes less crashes, and therefor
less people *asking* for us to debug it?

Remember - when a user tries a Linux box with a proprietary module, and the
experience sucks because the module sucks, they will walk away thinking
"Linux sucks", not "That module sucks".
