Subject: [PATCH 236/390] lttng-instrumentation-net-fix-null-napi

LTTng instrumentation net fix NULL napi

Hi Mathieu, LTT devs,
  I found that I needed this patch to allow LTT 0.116 to play nice with
  v2.6.29.  I am not 100% sure that I am not papering over a legitimate
  issue w.r.t napi->dev being legally NULL.  But FWIW, this patch allowed
  me to get 0.116 up and running.  Note that I saw the same issue in 0.110
  against 29-rc8, but I didnt persue since the newer trees were available.
  I suspect the same patch would fix things there as well.

  FWIW: The devices in question seemed to be the built-in skb-queues that
  are used as a psuedo device when you use netif_rx().  In these cases
  dev == NULL (not sure if this is by design).  However, since this path
  is probably not that common unless you are using something like tuntap,
  I suspect it might be that this has just been a latent bug in LTT.

Regards,
-Greg

lttng: fix net events to check for null n->dev

Applies to 29-v0.116

Certain napi structures may have a NULL device, and thus will crash when
the net-tracer'er is installed.
