Subject: [PATCH 3/3] wrnote: create dummy wrs_sys_info.h

wrnote will look for include/linux/wrs_sys_info.h for system
information. That file is generated by the internal build
process. If you build out off this system, things break.

The solution it to provide a dummy file that can then be
over written by the build process.
