Subject: [PATCH] intel_pstate: Set CPU number before accessing MSRs

commit 179e8471673ce0249cd4ecda796008f7757e5bad upstream.

Ensure that cpu->cpu is set before writing MSR_IA32_PERF_CTL during CPU
initialization. Otherwise only cpu0 has its P-state set and all other
cores are left with their values unchanged.

In most cases, this is not too serious because the P-states will be set
correctly when the timer function is run.  But when the default governor
is set to performance, the per-CPU current_pstate stays the same forever
and no attempts are made to write the MSRs again.
