+Texas Instruments TPS65218 family
+
+The TPS65218 are Integrated Power Management Chips.
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible : Must be "ti,tps65218";
+  For Integrated power-management used in AM437x based boards
+- interrupts : This i2c device has an IRQ line connected to the main SoC
+- interrupt-controller : Since the tps65218 supports several interrupts
+  internally, it is considered as an interrupt controller cascaded to the
+  SoC one.
+- #interrupt-cells = <2>;
+- interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller which is gic.
+
+Optional node:
+- TPS65218 PMIC has a number of child nodes. Mainly the regularors and SMPSs.
+
+Example:
+/*
