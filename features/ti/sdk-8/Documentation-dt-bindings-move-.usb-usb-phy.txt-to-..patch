Subject: [PATCH 0252/1587] Documentation: dt bindings: move ..usb/usb-phy.txt
 to ..phy/ti-phy.txt

commit 8d7212bc4107b343e93c13aa30c70b845f7f94ad upstream

Since now we have a separate folder for phy, move the PHY dt binding
documentation of TI to that folder.

+TI PHY: DT DOCUMENTATION FOR PHYs in TI PLATFORMs

+
+Optional properties:
+ - ctrl-module : phandle of the control module used by PHY driver to power on
