Subject: [PATCH 0872/1587] of: only scan for reserved mem when fdt present

commit 2040b52768ebab6e7bd73af0dc63703269c62f17 upstream

When the reserved memory patches hit -next, several legacy (non-DT) boot
failures were detected and bisected down to that commit. There needs to
be some sanity checking whether a DT is even present before parsing the
reserved ranges.
