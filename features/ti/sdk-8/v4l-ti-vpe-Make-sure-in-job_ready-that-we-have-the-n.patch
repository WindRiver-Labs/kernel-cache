Subject: [PATCH 0196/1587] v4l: ti-vpe: Make sure in job_ready that we have
 the needed number of dst_bufs

commit db476163da7b53433ea1c4080625fa56daf6fdda upstream

VPE has a ctrl parameter which decides how many mem to mem transactions the
active job from the job queue can perform.

The driver's job_ready() made sure that the number of ready source buffers are
sufficient for the job to execute successfully. But it didn't make sure if
there are sufficient ready destination buffers in the capture queue for the
VPE output.

If the time taken by VPE to process a single frame is really slow, then it's
possible that we don't need to imply such a restriction on the dst queue, but
really fast transactions(small resolution, no de-interlacing) may cause us to
hit the condition where we don't have any free buffers for the VPE to write on.

Add the extra check in job_ready() to make sure we have the sufficient amount
of destination buffers.
