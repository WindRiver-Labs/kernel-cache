Subject: [PATCH 0727/1587] wlcore: consider multiple APs when checking
 active_link_count

commit 41ed1a787c4940d58d5870c633ab6291dd4679dd upstream

Each AP has its own global and broadcast links, so when
checking for active sta count (according to the active_link_count)
we must take them all into account.
