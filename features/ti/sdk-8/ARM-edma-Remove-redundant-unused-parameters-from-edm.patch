Subject: [PATCH 0461/1587] ARM: edma: Remove redundant/unused parameters from
 edma_soc_info

commit 903ed4913c7fe78d2746445564634264291c7493 upstream

The following parameters are no longer needed by the edma driver since the
information can be obtained from the IP's CCCFG register:
n_channel, n_region, n_slot and n_tc.
Remove the n_cc as well since in this context it has no meaning. We have
separate edma_soc_info struct/eDMA3_CC instance so this member does not
make any sense (and the driver no longer uses it).
