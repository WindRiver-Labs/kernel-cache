Subject: [PATCH 0300/1587] bus: omap_l3_noc: Fix copyright information

commit c5f2aea0ef47b2934b46374abfac9015de79aecb upstream

This is an embarrassing patch :(.

Texas Corporation does not make OMAP. Texas Instruments Inc does.

For that matter I dont seem to be able to find a Texas Corporation on
the internet either.

While at it, update coverage to the current year and update the template
to remove redundant information and use the standard boiler plate
licensing.
