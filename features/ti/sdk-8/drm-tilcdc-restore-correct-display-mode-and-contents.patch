Subject: [PATCH 0711/1587] drm/tilcdc: restore correct display mode and
 contents on pm resume

On resume the screen contents were not being restored properly.  Looking at
other DRM drivers it seems a call to drm_helper_resume_force_mode() is needed
in the resume handler to force restoration of the mode and framebuffer data.
