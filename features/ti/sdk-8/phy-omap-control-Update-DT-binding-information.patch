+Required properties:

+ "ti,control-phy-otghs" - if it has otghs_control mailbox register as on OMAP4.
+ "ti,control-phy-usb2" - if it has Power down bit in control_dev_conf register
+                        e.g. USB2_PHY on OMAP5.
+ "ti,control-phy-pipe3" - if it has DPLL and individual Rx & Tx power control
+                        e.g. USB3 PHY and SATA PHY on OMAP5.

+                        AM437 platform.
+ - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device. It contains
+   the address of "otghs_control" for control-phy-otghs or "power" register
+   for other types.
