Subject: [PATCH] sched: Fix the broken sched_rr_get_interval()

commit a59f4e079d19464eebb9b06513a1d4f55fdae5ba upstream.

The caller of sched_sliced() should pass se.cfs_rq and se as the
arguments, however in sched_rr_get_interval() we gave it
rq.cfs_rq and se, which made the following computation obviously
wrong.

The change was introduced by commit:

  77034937dc45 sched: fix crash in sys_sched_rr_get_interval()

... 5 years ago, while it had been the correct 'cfs_rq_of' before
the commit. The change seems to be irrelevant to the commit
msg, which was to return a 0 timeslice for tasks that are on an
idle runqueue. So I believe that was just a plain typo.

[ Since this is an ABI and an old bug, we'll test this via a
  slow upstream route, to hopefully discover any app breakage. ]
