Subject: [PATCH 067/159] arch/powerpc: Release the lock when ncr_read()
 completes.

git.yoctoproject.org/git/linux-yocto-3.10
commit 76f19f08230db7cadd6e2643c54b5fd8822f7f33 standard/axxia/base.

The RTE is an external module that allows the rest of the Axxia
hardware (the network processor part) to be used.

Until the RTE gets loaded, there are no problems whatsoever.
The RTE and Linux both use the Config Ring (ncr) to access
some hardware registers. As both can access the config ring,
a synchronization mechanism is needed. There is a synchronization
mechanism included in the hardware. The Linux driver, as well as
the external module, use that mechanism. In this case, the Linux
driver was not releasing the lock.
