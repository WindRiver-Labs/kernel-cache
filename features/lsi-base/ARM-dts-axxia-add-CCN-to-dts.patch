Subject: [PATCH 30/68] ARM: dts: axxia: add CCN to dts

the patch comes from:
git://git.yoctoproject.org/linux-yocto-3.10
commit 9edcd853aff2e6aec0e568148f9cab47d3429c94 upstream

Add ccn-504 to dts, used by the ARM CCN driver.
The CCN driver support the CCN-504 bus and allows for
event counter readout through perf. See Documentation/arm/CCN.txt

Axxia AXM55xx supports XP nodes 0-10 and HFN nodes
3,5,7,8,13,15,17,18.

Note that the CCN perf driver utilizes the sysfs and therefore
requires the perf cli tool from kernel 3.14 or later.
