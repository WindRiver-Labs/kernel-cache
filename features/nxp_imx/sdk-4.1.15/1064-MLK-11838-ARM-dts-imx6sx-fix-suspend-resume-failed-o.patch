Subject: [PATCH 1064/1691] MLK-11838 ARM: dts: imx6sx: fix suspend/resume
 failed on i.mx6sx-sdb-reva board

commit d5989954c86613daf915231e9dbcfbc0cb6ac41f from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

There is one ROM bug on i.mx6sx TO1.1 that default ROM code use the old
ocram space 0x900000, but it should be 0x8f8000. So SW workaround need to
be added, unfortunately, the 'romcp' device node not added in i.mx6sx dtsi
on v4.1, thus i.mx6sx-sdb-reva board will be failed to resume back, add them
back.
