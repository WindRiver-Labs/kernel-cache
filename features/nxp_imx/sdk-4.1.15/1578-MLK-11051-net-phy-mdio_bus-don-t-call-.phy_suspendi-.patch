Subject: [PATCH 1578/1691] MLK-11051 net: phy: mdio_bus: don't call
 .phy_suspendi() when netdev is NULL

commit 0d406ab67926155489c0cce71db365a2770ab097 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

In .mdio_bus_phy_may_suspend(), there check netdev is NULL to judge to set
phy to suspend status.

netdev is NULL has three cases:
- phy is not found
- phy is found, match to general phy driver
- phy is found, match to specifical phy driver

Case 1: phy is not found, cannot communicate by MDIO bus.
Case 2: phy is found:
        if phy dev driver probe/bind err, netdev is not __open__ status,
           mdio bus is unregistered.
        if phy is detached, phy had entered suspended status.
Case 3: phy is found, phy is detached, phy had entered suspended status.

So, in here, it shouldn't set phy to suspend by calling mdio bus.

In i.MX6UL evk/arm2 board, if down the ethx interface and do suspend/resume,
system will hang. Because after ethx down all clocks are gated off, for general
phy driver, unbind the phy device, for specifical phy driver, no unbind the
device, and the original driver call mdio bus to set phy to suspend during
system suspend, so system will hang since there have mdio register access.
The patch can fix it.
