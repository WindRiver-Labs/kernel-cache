Subject: [PATCH 0194/1691] MLK-10101-4 usb: add otg_fsm pointer in usb_bus

commit 5d4549ccb80a3abdc9437980284fc0a136560b37 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

Add otg_fsm pointer in struct of usb_bus for access otg_fsm via bus.
Original way was to put it in usb_otg, then usb host can access otg_fsm
via hcd->usb_phy->otg->fsm, since usb_phy will not be the future direction,
instead phy is preferred, so this way may not work. It's more direct and
simple to put it in usb_bus.
