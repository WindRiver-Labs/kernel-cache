Subject: [PATCH 0941/1691] MLK-11502 dts: imx7d-sdb: change ramp up delay for
 VDD_SD1 regulator

commit 4bea3379d2ae862b57e75d67fed5ab928b4ff4e2 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

Currently the ramp up delay for VDD_SD1 regulator is 1s, the delay
is added in the following patch:

   commit 558c8cde973b9b2abf9a69e3be5a887d38185da3
   MLK-11277 dts: imx7d-sdb: add ramp up delay for VDD_SD1 regulator

Here we find this delay will also impact the sd1 resume time cost, and
1s is too much for the sd1 resume, so we try to reduce the delay time
of this VDD_SD1 regulator, finally 200ms pass our test.

This patch change the ramp up delay for VDD_SD1 regulator from 1s to
200ms.
