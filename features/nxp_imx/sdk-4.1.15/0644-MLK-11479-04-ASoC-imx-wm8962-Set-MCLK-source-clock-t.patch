Subject: [PATCH 0644/1691] MLK-11479-04 ASoC: imx-wm8962: Set MCLK source
 clock to 0Hz in hw_free()

commit e4b5f5b6a6a0f10d4c1703096388e7ae458b2410 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

cherry-pick below patch from v3.14.y:
ENGR00274386-2 ASoC: imx-wm8962: Set MCLK source clock to 0Hz in hw_free()

When DAPM closed WM8962 after playback, its driver would prompt
'wm8962 0-001a: Unsupported sysclk ratio 500' due to the invalid
divisor calculated by WM8962 codec driver.

To fix it, we can work around by setting its MCLK source to 0Hz,
so the codec driver would never get an invalid divisor any more.
Since hw_params() would re-set the MCLK source, no need to worry
about any side-effect.
