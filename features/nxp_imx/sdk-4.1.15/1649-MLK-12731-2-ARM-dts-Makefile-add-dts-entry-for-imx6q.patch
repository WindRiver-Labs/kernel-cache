Subject: [PATCH 1649/1691] MLK-12731-2 ARM: dts: Makefile: add dts entry for
 imx6q-arm2-hsic

commit e6ea96a8fc8176dbb83484cfedef1ec04daa4ca4 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

This dts is only for USB HSIC controller test which needs
Validation Port Card on it.

Disable controller 3 due to strange signal on it at arm2 board.
