Subject: [PATCH 1625/1691] MLK-12675 ARM: dts: imx: keep RTC enabled for
 software poweroff

commit 92c77573725e7e7715a724f98c7a60bea34f2f9e from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

SRTC needs to be kept enabled during system poweroff,
SNVS_LP control register bit 0 SRTC_ENV must be set
to enable RTC, for software poweroff, kernel just
read the register offset and value from dtb and write
to SNVS_LP control register to poweroff system, need
to make sure bit 0 SRTC_ENV is set to enable RTC during
system poweroff.

Previous setting did NOT enable it which will cause
RTC stop running if using software poweroff.
