Subject: [PATCH 1237/1691] MLK-12027: ARM: dts: fix the sample rate clock not
 accurate for spdif tx

commit bef020962334c0124165cf26142391eb31d88825 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

Clock of spdif tx is derived from clk_ipg and clk_osc, which is not the
integer multiple size of sample rate, can't generate accurate clock for
each sample rate. Use pll4 as the clk_spdif's parent, because the clk_spdif
is the one of source clock of tx, use a proper frequency for pll4, then it
can generate more accurate clock for sample rate (32k,48k,96k,192k).
