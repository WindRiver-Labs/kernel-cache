drivers/net/wireless/bcmdhd/dhd_common.c:108:38: error: macro "__TIME__" might prevent reproducible builds [-Werror=date-time]
  DHD_COMPILED " on " __DATE__ " at " __TIME__;

Drop debug version with build date/time.
The kernel already has this information, and individual drivers
shouldn't duplicate that.  This also eliminates the use of __DATE__ and
__TIME__, which make the build non-deterministic.

(cherry picked from commit 3f47e9588c8acf5c4cc5079e746bc05e7d5c69ec)
