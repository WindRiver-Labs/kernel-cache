Subject: [PATCH 1463/1691] MLK-12182 ARM: imx: add M4 ddr image DSM support on
 i.MX7D

commit d31591d18d7f6f01bb9b5c5053fd0a17370a61eb from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

For DSM mode, M4 TCM context is lost and A7 will restore them
after resume and write TCM entry to M4 and re-kick it. It
assumes M4 is running on TCM, but M4 also has case of running
image on DDR, OCRAMS first 2 words stores the stack and pc
address for M4, to support M4 running on both TCM and DDR
case, we can just leave the OCRAMS first 3 words unchanged
during DSM, the third words is also reserved for M4, as OCRAMS
can keep its context during DSM.

This patch leaves OCRAMS first 3 words unchanged and remove
the re-program of TCM entry after exit from DSM, thus it can
support DSM mode for M4 running on TCM/DDR/OCRAM.
