Subject: [PATCH 0696/1691] MLK-11437-01 ARM: dts: imx: correct the clock info
 of cpu node

commit 401013014ccb6addab080c0495358b343486fb94 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

The pll1_bypass and pll1_bypass_src clock index  in cpu node
should be IMX6SX_PLL1_BYPASS and IMX6SX_PLL1_BYPASS_SRC,
so correct this.
