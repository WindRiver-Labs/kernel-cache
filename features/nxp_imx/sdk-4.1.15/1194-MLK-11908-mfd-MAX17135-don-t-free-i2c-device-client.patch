Subject: [PATCH 1194/1691] MLK-11908 mfd: MAX17135: don't free i2c device
 client

commit 8344037faa80b055f4a4a7b76e223b9799728753 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

i2c device client shouldn't be freed by i2c device driver, there have
problems in below cases:
- one device match to different drivers, the second matched driver will
  cannot access i2c device client if it is freed by the first matched driver.
- one module driver insmod: the first insmod fail free client due to system
  low memory, after kswapd system free pages and has enough free pages, the
  second insmod will cause match failed.
