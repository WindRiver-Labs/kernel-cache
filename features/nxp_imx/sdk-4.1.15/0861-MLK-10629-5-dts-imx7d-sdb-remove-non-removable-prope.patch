Subject: [PATCH 0861/1691] MLK-10629-5 dts: imx7d-sdb: remove non-removable
 property of wifi host

commit 70912dda39cf8243237518b5dc3a9e91d8664bb0 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

The card detect of Broadcom WiFi on uSDHC2 port can not function
well with a non-removalbe card. Because MMC core only enumerate
one time for non-removable card which is not work for Broadcom WiFI.
So remove it.
