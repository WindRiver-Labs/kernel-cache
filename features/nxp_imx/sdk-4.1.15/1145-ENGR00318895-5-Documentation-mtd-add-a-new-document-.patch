Subject: [PATCH 1145/1691] ENGR00318895-5 Documentation: mtd: add a new
 document for SPI NOR flash

commit ba8582d13b263ff9cacb750b407222ffe3231c20 from
git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_4.1.15_1.0.0_ga

We need a DT property to store the dummy cycles for DDR Quad read.
This is a common feature for the SPI NOR flash, such as Spansion and Micron
chips.

Add this file to describe this specific SPI NOR flash features which will
be referred by the SPI NOR flash drivers.
