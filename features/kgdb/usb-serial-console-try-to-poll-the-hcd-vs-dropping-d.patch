Subject: [PATCH 02/28] usb-serial-console: try to poll the hcd vs dropping
 data

This patch tries to solve the problem that printk data is dropped
because there are too many outstanding transmit urb's while trying to
execute printk's to a console.  You can observe this by booting a
kernel with a serial console and cross checking the dmesg output with
what you received on the console or doing something like
"echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger".

This patch takes the route of forcibly polling the hcd device to drain
the urb queue in order to initiate the bulk write call backs.

A few millisecond penalty will get incurred to allow the hcd
controller to complete a write urb, else the console data is thrown
away.  Even with any kind of delay, the latency is still lower than
using a traditional serial port uart due to the fact that there are
bigger buffers for use with the USB serial console kfifo
implementation.
