Subject: dmaengine: at_hdmac: trivial: fix comment in header

commit 9102d8715e5c10db37d81ab75285a2f6746360b2 upstream.

Not all Atmel SoCs were pointed out in header comment which was bringing
confusion. Remove the truncated list of supported devices, replace by the
only one that is not supported.
