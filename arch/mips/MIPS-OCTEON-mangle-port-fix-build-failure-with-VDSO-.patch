Subject: [PATCH] MIPS: OCTEON: mangle-port: fix build failure with VDSO code

Patch got from https://patchwork.linux-mips.org/patch/14039/

Commit 1685ddbe35cd ("MIPS: Octeon: Changes to support readq()/writeq()
usage.") added bitwise shift operations that assume that unsigned long
is always 64-bits. This broke the build of VDSO code, as it gets compiled
also in "faked" 32-bit mode. Althought the failing inline functions are
never executed in 32-bit mode, they still need to pass the compilation.
Fix by using 64-bit types explicitly.

The patch fixes the following build failure:
