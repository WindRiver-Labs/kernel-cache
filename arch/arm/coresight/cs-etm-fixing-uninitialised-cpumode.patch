Subject: [PATCH 50/59] cs-etm: fixing uninitialised cpumode

Original patch taken from: https://github.com/Linaro/OpenCSD.git

The following patch[1] adds a new "cpumode" to the perf_sample
structure that gets initialised as events are read from the data
event file.

With the advent of HW tracers and more specifically the decoding of
the traces they generate, function perf_session__deliver_synth_event()
gets called directly from the infrastructure that decodes the traces,
for example[2].

As such initialisation of perf_sample::cpumode doesn't get done, which
prevents the shared object name from being printed in the perf report
output.

The patch simply initialise the new cpumode variable with the value the
code was originally using.
