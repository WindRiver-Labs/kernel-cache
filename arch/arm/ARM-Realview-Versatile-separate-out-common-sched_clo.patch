Subject: [PATCH 4/5] ARM: Realview/Versatile: separate out common sched_clock()

commit f5fc00826d1e60af0e22cb9f65b933d823a8ed84 upstream

Provide a common sched_clock() implementation for Versatile and
Realview.

Signed-off-by: Russell King <rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk>
[remove the changes to mach-versatile and mach-realview since they haven't switch
to plat-versatile in wrlinux]
