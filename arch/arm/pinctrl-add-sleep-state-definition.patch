Subject: [PATCH 17/20] pinctrl: add sleep state definition

Upstream ID: 65697e6b1a7d73d82d114377b448e89b9788e26b

There is an IDLE definition in the pinctrl framework, but for
ux500 SLEEP is more apropriate.

I've added some comments on the semantics of the common states
so as to avoid misunderstandings.

ChangeLog v1->v2:
- Fixed terminology "on"->"into".
