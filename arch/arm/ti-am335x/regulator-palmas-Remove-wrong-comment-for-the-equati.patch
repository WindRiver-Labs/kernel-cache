Subject: [PATCH 0937/1115] regulator: palmas: Remove wrong comment for the
 equation calculating num_voltages

Current equation on the comment is wrong.
For linear mapping starting from 0, the equation is (maxV-minV)/stepV + 1.
Since the linear mapping for PALMAS is not all starting from 0, the equation
on the comment is not useful and misleading. Thus remove it.
