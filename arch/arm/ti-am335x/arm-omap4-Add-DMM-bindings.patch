+		Must be "ti,omap5-dmm" for OMAP5 family
+- reg:		Contains timer register address range (base address and length)
+- interrupts:	Contains interrupt information (source, etc) for the DMM IRQ
+- ti,hwmods:	Name of the hwmod associated to the counter, which is typically
+		"dmm"

+Example:
+
+dmm: dmm@4e000000 {

+	reg = <0x4e000000 0x800>;
+	ti,hwmods = "dmm";
