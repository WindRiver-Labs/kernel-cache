Subject: [PATCH 0573/1115] pinconf-generic: add BIAS_BUS_HOLD pinconf

Add a new PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_BUS_HOLD pin configuration for a bus holder
pin mode (also known as bus keeper, or repeater). This is a weak latch
which drives the last value on a tristate bus. Another device on the bus
can drive the bus high or low before going tristate to change the value
driven by the pin.
