Subject: [PATCH 0890/1115] cpufreq: Fix wrong time unit conversion

The time spent by a CPU under a given frequency is stored in jiffies unit
in the cpu var cpufreq_stats_table->time_in_state[i], i being the index of
the frequency.

This is what is displayed in the following file on the right column:

     cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/cpufreq/stats/time_in_state
     2301000 19835820
     2300000 3172
     [...]

Now cpufreq converts this jiffies unit delta to clock_t before returning it
to the user as in the above file. And that conversion is achieved using the API
cputime64_to_clock_t().

Although it accidentally works on traditional tick based cputime accounting, where
cputime_t maps directly to jiffies, it doesn't work with other types of cputime
accounting such as CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_* where cputime_t can map to nsecs
or any granularity preffered by the architecture.

For example we get a buggy zero delta on full dyntick configurations:

     cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/cpufreq/stats/time_in_state
     2301000 0
     2300000 0
     [...]

Fix this with using the proper jiffies_64_t to clock_t conversion.
