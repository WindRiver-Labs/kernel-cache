Subject: [PATCH 0921/1115] regulator: palmas-pmic: doc: fix typo for
 sleep-mode

commit 3c870e3f9d9d98f1ab98614b3b1fd5c79287d361
(regulator: palmas: Change the DT node property names to follow the convention)

Missed updating mode-sleep from sleep-mode. Fix the same.

Documentation example seems proper for this property.
