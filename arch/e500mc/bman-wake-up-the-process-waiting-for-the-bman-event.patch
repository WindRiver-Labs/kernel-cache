Subject: [PATCH 144/252] bman: wake up the process waiting for the bman event

In bman some functions such as wait_rel_start/wait_rel_commit
are put to affini_queue wait queue and wait for a bman event.
But they are not waked up by any function in the current driver,
and will block forever. So wake up these processes in the bman
interrupt handler.
