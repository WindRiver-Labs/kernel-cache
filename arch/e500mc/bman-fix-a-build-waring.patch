Subject: [PATCH 202/252] bman: fix a build waring

The "__always_unused" is already defined in current kernel.
So remove the definition in bman header file to fix the following
build warning.
In file included from drivers/hwalloc/bman_private.h:33,
                 from drivers/hwalloc/bman_high.c:38:
drivers/hwalloc/bman_sys.h:122: warning: "__always_unused" redefined
include/linux/compiler-gcc.h:86: note: this is the location of the previous definition
