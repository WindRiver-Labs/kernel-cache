Subject: [PATCH 129/132] Documentation: mtd: add a new document for SPI NOR
 flash

We need a DT property to store the dummy cycles for DDR Quad read.
This is a common feature for the SPI NOR flash, such as Spansion and Micron
chips.
Add this file to describe this specific SPI NOR flash features which will
be referred by the SPI NOR flash drivers.
