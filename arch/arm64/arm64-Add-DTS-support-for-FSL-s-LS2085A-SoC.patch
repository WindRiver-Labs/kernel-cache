Subject: [PATCH 022/132] arm64: Add DTS support for FSL's LS2085A SoC

commit 747c84d051949872be54fcbceb5174b5779c6a17 upstream

This patch adds the device tree support for FSL LS2085A SoC
based on ARMv8 architecture.

Following levels of DTSI/DTS files have been created for the
LS2085A SoC family:

- fsl-ls2085a.dtsi:
DTS-Include file for FSL LS2085A SoC.

- fsl-ls2085a-simu.dts:
DTS file for FSL LS2085a software simulator model.

In addition, this patch adds build support for FSL's LS2085A
simulator model in arm64 dts Makefile.

[These files are different from mainline, so this patch
 is not same as upstream.]
