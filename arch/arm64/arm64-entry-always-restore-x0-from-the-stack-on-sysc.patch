Subject: [PATCH] arm64: entry: always restore x0 from the stack on syscall
 return

commit 412fcb6cebd758d080cacd5a41a0cbc656ea5fce upstream

We have a micro-optimisation on the fast syscall return path where we
take care to keep x0 live with the return value from the syscall so that
we can avoid restoring it from the stack. The benefit of doing this is
fairly suspect, since we will be restoring x1 from the stack anyway
(which lives adjacent in the pt_regs structure) and the only additional
cost is saving x0 back to pt_regs after the syscall handler, which could
be seen as a poor man's prefetch.

More importantly, this causes issues with the context tracking code.

The ct_user_enter macro ends up branching into C code, which is free to
use x0 as a scratch register and consequently leads to us returning junk
back to userspace as the syscall return value. Rather than special case
the context-tracking code, this patch removes the questionable
optimisation entirely.
