Subject: [PATCH 352/430] irqchip: gic: use dmb ishst instead of dsb when
 raising a softirq

When sending an SGI to another CPU, we require a barrier to ensure that
any pending stores to normal memory are made visible to the recipient
before the interrupt arrives.

Rather than use a vanilla dsb() (which will soon cause an assembly error
on arm64) before the writel_relaxed, we can instead use dsb(ishst),
since we just need to ensure that any pending normal writes are visible
within the inner-shareable domain before we poke the GIC.

With this observation, we can then further weaken the barrier to a
dmb(ishst), since other CPUs in the inner-shareable domain must observe
the write to the distributor before the SGI is generated.
