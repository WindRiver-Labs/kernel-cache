Subject: [PATCH 21/24] pwm: lpss: Fix const qualifier and sparse warnings

Fixes the following warnings reported by the 0-DAY kernel build testing
backend:

   drivers/pwm/pwm-lpss.c: In function 'pwm_lpss_probe_pci':
>> drivers/pwm/pwm-lpss.c:192:2: warning: passing argument 3 of 'pwm_lpss_probe' discards 'const' qualifier from pointer target type [enabled by default]
     lpwm = pwm_lpss_probe(&pdev->dev, &pdev->resource[0], info);
     ^
   drivers/pwm/pwm-lpss.c:130:30: note: expected 'struct pwm_lpss_boardinfo *' but argument is of type 'const struct pwm_lpss_boardinfo *'
    static struct pwm_lpss_chip *pwm_lpss_probe(struct device *dev,
                                 ^
>> drivers/pwm/pwm-lpss.c:143:28: sparse: incorrect type in return expression (different address spaces)
