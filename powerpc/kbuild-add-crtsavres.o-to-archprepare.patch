Subject: [PATCH] kbuild: add crtsavres.o to archprepare

upstream commit da3de6df33f5f42ff9dc40093fbc884f524c9a49 adds
a dependency to all kernel modules to crtsavres. This
ensures that out-of-line register saves/restores work when
CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE is enabled.

What it didn't do was ensure that it was built when
modules_prepare was run and hence out of tree powerpc kernel
modules can't properly link.

The fix is to add crtsavres.o to the archprepare rule in
the arch/powerpc/Makefile
