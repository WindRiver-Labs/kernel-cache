# Items listed in here are explicitly considered as non-hardware items,
# regardless of what Kconfig file they were found in.  Given there are
# some 7000 or more CONFIG items, the Kconfig files work remarkably well
# for sorting hardware vs non-hardware, but there are a few dolphins in
# the tuna net (e.g. typically device drivers that aren't really tied to
# a real piece of hardware).
