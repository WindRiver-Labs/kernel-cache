Subject: [PATCH] usb: revert bogus meaningless change from giant RT patch

This change originated in the giant RT "preempt-rt: -rt20 applied
to 2.6.34 -standard" patch.  It serves no function whatsoever.

It probably has origins dating back to when device locks were
declared per driver prior to the abstraction of mainline 8e9394ce.
