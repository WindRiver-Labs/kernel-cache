Subject: [PATCH] serial: PL011: move interrupt clearing

Commit 360f748b204275229f8398cb2f9f53955db1503b
"serial: PL011: clear pending interrupts"
attempts to clear interrupts by writing to a
yet-unassigned memory address. This fixes the issue.

The breaking patch is marked for stable so should be
carried along with the other patch.
