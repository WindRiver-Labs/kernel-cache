Subject: [PATCH 7/9] futex: Ensure get_futex_key_refs() always implies a
 barrier

commit 76835b0ebf8a7fe85beb03c75121419a7dec52f0 upstream

Commit b0c29f79ecea (futexes: Avoid taking the hb->lock if there's
nothing to wake up) changes the futex code to avoid taking a lock when
there are no waiters. This code has been subsequently fixed in commit
11d4616bd07f (futex: revert back to the explicit waiter counting code).
Both the original commit and the fix-up rely on get_futex_key_refs() to
always imply a barrier.

However, for private futexes, none of the cases in the switch statement
of get_futex_key_refs() would be hit and the function completes without
a memory barrier as required before checking the "waiters" in
futex_wake() -> hb_waiters_pending(). The consequence is a race with a
thread waiting on a futex on another CPU, allowing the waker thread to
read "waiters == 0" while the waiter thread to have read "futex_val ==
locked" (in kernel).

Without this fix, the problem (user space deadlocks) can be seen with
Android bionic's mutex implementation on an arm64 multi-cluster system.
