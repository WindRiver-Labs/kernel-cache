Subject: [PATCH 67/89] TPM: Long default timeout fix

commit c4ff4b829ef9e6353c0b133b7adb564a68054979 upstream.

If duration variable value is 0 at this point, it's because
chip->vendor.duration wasn't filled by tpm_get_timeouts() yet.
This patch sets then the lowest timeout just to give enough
time for tpm_get_timeouts() to further succeed.

This fix avoids long boot times in case another entity attempts
to send commands to the TPM when the TPM isn't accessible.
