Subject: [PATCH] ARM: Ensure predictable endian state on signal handler entry

commit 53399053eb505cf541b2405bd9d9bca5ecfb96fb upstream.

Ensure a predictable endian state when entering signal handlers.  This
avoids programs which use SETEND to momentarily switch their endian
state from having their signal handlers entered with an unpredictable
endian state.
