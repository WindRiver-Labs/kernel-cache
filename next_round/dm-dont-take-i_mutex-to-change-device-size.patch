Subject: [PATCH 72/89] dm: dont take i_mutex to change device size

commit c217649bf2d60ac119afd71d938278cffd55962b upstream.

No longer needlessly hold md->bdev->bd_inode->i_mutex when changing the
size of a DM device.  This additional locking is unnecessary because
i_size_write() is already protected by the existing critical section in
dm_swap_table().  DM already has a reference on md->bdev so the
associated bd_inode may be changed without lifetime concerns.

A negative side-effect of having held md->bdev->bd_inode->i_mutex was
that a concurrent DM device resize and flush (via fsync) would deadlock.
Dropping md->bdev->bd_inode->i_mutex eliminates this potential for
deadlock.  The following reproducer no longer deadlocks:
