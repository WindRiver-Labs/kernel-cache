Subject: [PATCH] USB: serial: ch341: add new id

commit d0781383038e983a63843a9a6a067ed781db89c1 upstream.

I picked up a new DAK-780EX(professional digitl reverb/mix system),
which use CH341T chipset to communication with computer on 3/2011
and the CH341T's vendor code is 1a86

Looking up the CH341T's vendor and product id's I see:

1a86  QinHeng Electronics
  5523  CH341 in serial mode, usb to serial port converter

CH341T,CH341 are the products of the same company, maybe
have some common hardware, and I test the ch341.c works
well with CH341T
