Subject: [PATCH 02/13] ck: mm minimal swappiness

Integrating and porting from:

  http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/3.0/3.4/3.4-ck2/patches/

[I've yet to find any desktop workload that benefits from anything higher than
a swappiness as low as possible. Unfortunately setting it to zero can rarely
lead to unexplained stalls in the VM so use 10.
