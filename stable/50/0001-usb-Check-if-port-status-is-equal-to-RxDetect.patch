Subject: [PATCH] usb: Check if port status is equal to RxDetect

commit bb86cf569bbd7ad4dce581a37c7fbd748057e9dc upstream.

When using USB 3.0 pen drive with the [AMD] FCH USB XHCI Controller
[1022:7814], the second hotplugging will experience the USB 3.0 pen
drive is recognized as high-speed device. After bisecting the kernel,
I found the commit number 41e7e056cdc662f704fa9262e5c6e213b4ab45dd
(USB: Allow USB 3.0 ports to be disabled.) causes the bug. After doing
some experiments, the bug can be fixed by avoiding executing the function
hub_usb3_port_disable(). Because the port status with [AMD] FCH USB
XHCI Controlleris [1022:7814] is already in RxDetect
(I tried printing out the port status before setting to Disabled state),
it's reasonable to check the port status before really executing
hub_usb3_port_disable().

Fixes: 41e7e056cdc6 (USB: Allow USB 3.0 ports to be disabled.)
