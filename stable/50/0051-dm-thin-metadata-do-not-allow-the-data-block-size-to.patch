Subject: [PATCH] dm thin metadata: do not allow the data block size to change

commit 9aec8629ec829fc9403788cd959e05dd87988bd1 upstream.

The block size for the thin-pool's data device must remained fixed for
the life of the thin-pool.  Disallow any attempt to change the
thin-pool's data block size.

It should be noted that attempting to change the data block size via
thin-pool table reload will be ignored as a side-effect of the thin-pool
handover that the thin-pool target does during thin-pool table reload.

Here is an example outcome of attempting to load a thin-pool table that
reduced the thin-pool's data block size from 1024K to 512K.

Before:
kernel: device-mapper: thin: 253:4: growing the data device from 204800 to 409600 blocks

After:
kernel: device-mapper: thin metadata: changing the data block size (from 2048 to 1024) is not supported
kernel: device-mapper: table: 253:4: thin-pool: Error creating metadata object
kernel: device-mapper: ioctl: error adding target to table
