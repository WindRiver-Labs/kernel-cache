Subject: [PATCH] drm/qxl: return IRQ_NONE if it was not our irq

commit fbb60fe35ad579b511de8604b06a30b43846473b upstream.

Return IRQ_NONE if it was not our irq. This is necessary for the case
when qxl is sharing irq line with a device A in a crash kernel. If qxl
is initialized before A and A's irq was raised during this gap,
returning IRQ_HANDLED in this case will cause this irq to be raised
again after EOI since kernel think it was handled but in fact it was
not.
