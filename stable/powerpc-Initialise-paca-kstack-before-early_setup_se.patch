Subject: [PATCH] powerpc: Initialise paca->kstack before early_setup_secondary

commit f761622e59433130bc33ad086ce219feee9eb961 upstream.

As early setup calls down to slb_initialize(), we must have kstack
initialised before checking "should we add a bolted SLB entry for our kstack?"

Failing to do so means stack access requires an SLB miss exception to refill
an entry dynamically, if the stack isn't accessible via SLB(0) (kernel text
& static data).  It's not always allowable to take such a miss, and
intermittent crashes will result.

Primary CPUs don't have this issue; an SLB entry is not bolted for their
stack anyway (as that lives within SLB(0)).  This patch therefore only
affects the init of secondaries.
