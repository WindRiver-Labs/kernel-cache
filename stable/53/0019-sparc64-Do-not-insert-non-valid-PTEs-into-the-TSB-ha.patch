Subject: [PATCH] sparc64: Do not insert non-valid PTEs into the TSB hash
 table.

[ Upstream commit 18f38132528c3e603c66ea464727b29e9bbcb91b ]

The assumption was that update_mmu_cache() (and the equivalent for PMDs) would
only be called when the PTE being installed will be accessible by the user.

This is not true for code paths originating from remove_migration_pte().

There are dire consequences for placing a non-valid PTE into the TSB.  The TLB
miss frramework assumes thatwhen a TSB entry matches we can just load it into
the TLB and return from the TLB miss trap.

So if a non-valid PTE is in there, we will deadlock taking the TLB miss over
and over, never satisfying the miss.

Just exit early from update_mmu_cache() and friends in this situation.

Based upon a report and patch from Christopher Alexander Tobias Schulze.
