Subject: [PATCH] sunsab: Fix detection of BREAK on sunsab serial console

[ Upstream commit fe418231b195c205701c0cc550a03f6c9758fd9e ]

Fix detection of BREAK on sunsab serial console: BREAK detection was only
performed when there were also serial characters received simultaneously.
To handle all BREAKs correctly, the check for BREAK and the corresponding
call to uart_handle_break() must also be done if count == 0, therefore
duplicate this code fragment and pull it out of the loop over the received
characters.

Patch applies to 3.16-rc6.
