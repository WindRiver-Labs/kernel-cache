Subject: [PATCH] usb: iowarrior: don't trust report_size for buffer size

commit 3ed780117dbe5acb64280d218f0347f238dafed0 upstream.

If the iowarrior devices in this case statement support more than 8 bytes
per report, it is possible to write past the end of a kernel heap allocation.
This will probably never be possible, but change the allocation to be more
defensive anyway.
