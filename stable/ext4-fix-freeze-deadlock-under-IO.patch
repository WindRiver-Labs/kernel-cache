Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix freeze deadlock under IO

commit 437f88cc031ffe7f37f3e705367f4fe1f4be8b0f upstream.
[The 6b0310fb below references the mainline version of what
has also been cherry picked into this 34-stable branch]

Commit 6b0310fbf087ad6 caused a regression resulting in deadlocks
when freezing a filesystem which had active IO; the vfs_check_frozen
level (SB_FREEZE_WRITE) did not let the freeze-related IO syncing
through.  Duh.

Changing the test to FREEZE_TRANS should let the normal freeze
syncing get through the fs, but still block any transactions from
starting once the fs is completely frozen.

I tested this by running fsstress in the background while periodically
snapshotting the fs and running fsck on the result.  I ran into
occasional deadlocks, but different ones.  I think this is a
fine fix for the problem at hand, and the other deadlocky things
will need more investigation.
