Subject: [PATCH] ses: Avoid kernel panic when lun 0 is not mapped

commit d1e12de804f9d8ad114786ca7c2ce593cba79891 upstream.

During device discovery, scsi mid layer sends INQUIRY command to LUN
0. If the LUN 0 is not mapped to host, it creates a temporary
scsi_device with LUN id 0 and sends REPORT_LUNS command to it. After
the REPORT_LUNS succeeds, it walks through the LUN table and adds each
LUN found to sysfs. At the end of REPORT_LUNS lun table scan, it will
delete the temporary scsi_device of LUN 0.

When scsi devices are added to sysfs, it calls add_dev function of all
the registered class interfaces. If ses driver has been registered,
ses_intf_add() of ses module will be called. This function calls
scsi_device_enclosure() to check the inquiry data for EncServ
bit. Since inquiry was not allocated for temporary LUN 0 scsi_device,
it will cause NULL pointer exception.

To fix the problem, sdev->inquiry is checked for NULL before reading it.
