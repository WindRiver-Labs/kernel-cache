Subject: [PATCH] dmaengine: fix interrupt clearing for mv_xor

commit cc60f8878eab892c03d06b10f389232b9b66bd83 upstream.

When using simultaneously the two DMA channels on a same engine, some
transfers are never completed. For example, an endless lock can occur
while writing heavily on a RAID5 array (with async-tx offload support
enabled).

Note that this issue can also be reproduced by using the DMA test
client.

On a same engine, the interrupt cause register is shared between two
DMA channels. This patch make sure that the cause bit is only cleared
for the requested channel.
