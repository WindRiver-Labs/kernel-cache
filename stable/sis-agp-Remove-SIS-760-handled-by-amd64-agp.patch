Subject: [PATCH] sis-agp: Remove SIS 760, handled by amd64-agp

commit d831692a1a8e9ceaaa9bb16bb3fc503b7e372558 upstream.

SIS 760 is listed in the device tables for both amd64-agp and sis-agp.
amd64-agp is apparently preferable since it has workarounds for some
BIOS misconfigurations that sis-agp doesn't handle.
