Subject: [PATCH] tcp: Prevent overzealous packetization by SWS logic.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 01f83d69844d307be2aa6fea88b0e8fe5cbdb2f4 upstream.

If peer uses tiny MSS (say, 75 bytes) and similarly tiny advertised
window, the SWS logic will packetize to half the MSS unnecessarily.

This causes problems with some embedded devices.

However for large MSS devices we do want to half-MSS packetize
otherwise we never get enough packets into the pipe for things
like fast retransmit and recovery to work.

Be careful also to handle the case where MSS > window, otherwise
we'll never send until the probe timer.
