Subject: [PATCH 01/25] cifs: always do is_path_accessible check in cifs_mount

commit 70945643722ffeac779d2529a348f99567fa5c33 upstream.

Currently, we skip doing the is_path_accessible check in cifs_mount if
there is no prefixpath. I have a report of at least one server however
that allows a TREE_CONNECT to a share that has a DFS referral at its
root. The reporter in this case was using a UNC that had no prefixpath,
so the is_path_accessible check was not triggered and the box later hit
a BUG() because we were chasing a DFS referral on the root dentry for
the mount.

This patch fixes this by removing the check for a zero-length
prefixpath.  That should make the is_path_accessible check be done in
this situation and should allow the client to chase the DFS referral at
mount time instead.
