Subject: [PATCH] ses: show devices for enclosures with no page 7

commit 877a55979c189c590e819a61cbbe2b7947875f17 upstream.

enclosure page 7 gives us the "pretty" names of the enclosure slots.
Without a page 7, we can still use the enclosure code as long as we
make up numeric names for the slots. Unfortunately, the current code
fails to add any devices because the check for page 10 is in the wrong
place if we have no page 7.  Fix it so that devices show up even if
the enclosure has no page 7.
