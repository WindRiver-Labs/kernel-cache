Subject: [PATCH] orinoco: clear countermeasure setting on commit

commit ba34fcee476d11e7c9df95932787a22a96ff6e68 upstream.

... and interface up.

In these situations, you are usually trying to connect to a new AP, so
keeping TKIP countermeasures active is confusing. This is already how
the driver behaves (inadvertently). However, querying SIOCGIWAUTH may
tell userspace that countermeasures are active when they aren't.

Clear the setting so that the reporting matches what the driver has
done..
