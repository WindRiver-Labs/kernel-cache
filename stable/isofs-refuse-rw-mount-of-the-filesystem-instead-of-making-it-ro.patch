Subject: isofs: Refuse RW mount of the filesystem instead of making it RO

From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>

commit 17b7f7cf58926844e1dd40f5eb5348d481deca6a upstream.

Refuse RW mount of isofs filesystem. So far we just silently changed it
to RO mount but when the media is writeable, block layer won't notice
this change and thus will think device is used RW and will block eject
button of the drive. That is unexpected by users because for
non-writeable media eject button works just fine.

Userspace mount(8) command handles this just fine and retries mounting
with MS_RDONLY set so userspace shouldn't see any regression.  Plus any
tool mounting isofs is likely confronted with the case of read-only
media where block layer already refuses to mount the filesystem without
MS_RDONLY set so our behavior shouldn't be anything new for it.
