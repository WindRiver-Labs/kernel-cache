Subject: [PATCH] ext4: disable synchronous transaction batching if
 max_batch_time==0

commit 39f9c0e3dd12d559da1ad14a3082b02683285c8d in linux-stable

commit 5dd214248f94d430d70e9230bda72f2654ac88a8 upstream.

The mount manpage says of the max_batch_time option,

	This optimization can be turned off entirely
	by setting max_batch_time to 0.

But the code doesn't do that.  So fix the code to do
that.
