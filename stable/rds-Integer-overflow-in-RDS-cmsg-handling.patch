Subject: [PATCH] rds: Integer overflow in RDS cmsg handling

commit 218854af84038d828a32f061858b1902ed2beec6 upstream.

In rds_cmsg_rdma_args(), the user-provided args->nr_local value is
restricted to less than UINT_MAX.  This seems to need a tighter upper
bound, since the calculation of total iov_size can overflow, resulting
in a small sock_kmalloc() allocation.  This would probably just result
in walking off the heap and crashing when calling rds_rdma_pages() with
a high count value.  If it somehow doesn't crash here, then memory
corruption could occur soon after.
