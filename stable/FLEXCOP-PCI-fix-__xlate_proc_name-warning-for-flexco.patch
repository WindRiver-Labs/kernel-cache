Subject: [PATCH] FLEXCOP-PCI: fix __xlate_proc_name-warning for flexcop-pci

commit b934c20de1398d4a82d2ecfeb588a214a910f13f upstream.

This patch fixes the warning about bad names for sys-fs and other kernel-things. The flexcop-pci driver was using '/'-characters in it, which is not good.
This has been fixed in several attempts by several people, but obviously never made it into the kernel.
