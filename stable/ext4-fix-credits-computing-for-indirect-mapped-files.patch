Subject: [PATCH] ext4: fix credits computing for indirect mapped files

commit 5b41395fcc0265fc9f193aef9df39ce49d64677c upstream.

When writing a contiguous set of blocks, two indirect blocks could be
needed depending on how the blocks are aligned, so we need to increase
the number of credits needed by one.

[ Also fixed a another bug which could further underestimate the
  number of journal credits needed by 1; the code was using integer
  division instead of DIV_ROUND_UP() -- tytso]
