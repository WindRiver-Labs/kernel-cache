Subject: [PATCH] quota: Don't write quota info in dquot_commit()

commit b03f24567ce7caf2420b8be4c6eb74c191d59a91 upstream.

There's no reason to write quota info in dquot_commit(). The writing is a
relict from the old days when we didn't have dquot_acquire() and
dquot_release() and thus dquot_commit() could have created / removed quota
structures from the file. These days dquot_commit() only updates usage counters
/ limits in quota structure and thus there's no need to write quota info.

This also fixes an issue with journaling filesystem which didn't reserve
enough space in the transaction for write of quota info (it could have been
dirty at the time of dquot_commit() because of a race with other operation
changing it).
