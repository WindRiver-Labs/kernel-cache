Subject: HID: Fix Speedlink VAD Cezanne support for some devices

From: Stefan Kriwanek <dev@stefankriwanek.de>

commit 06bb5219118fb098f4b0c7dcb484b28a52bf1c14 upstream.

Some devices of the "Speedlink VAD Cezanne" model need more aggressive fixing
than already done.

I made sure through testing that this patch would not interfere with the proper
working of a device that is bug-free. (The driver drops EV_REL events with
abs(val) >= 256, which are not achievable even on the highest laser resolution
hardware setting.)
