Subject: [PATCH] ALSA: hda - Handle missing NID 0x1b on ALC259 codec

commit 5d4abf93ea3192cc666430225a29a4978c97c57d upstream.

Since ALC259/269 use the same parser of ALC268, the pin 0x1b was ignored
as an invalid widget.  Just add this NID to handle properly.
This will add the missing mixer controls for some devices.
