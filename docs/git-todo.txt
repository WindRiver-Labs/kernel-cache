things that are outstanding:
----------------------------

  - publish script
  - multi kernel builds in single tree
  - BSP branches
  - git checkout of a branch on clone when a platform
    is specified and kern_base=git
  - smudge running in standalone mode
  - patch extraction from git-repo automatically
  - scripts to rebase and keep branches up to date
