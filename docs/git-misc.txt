guilt
------


  # push 7 patches, this is the 'standard' kernel
  guilt push -n 7

  # create a cgl branch 
  guilt branch cgl

  # change back to the standard kernel
  git checkout master

  # push 1 patches
  guilt push -n 1

  # change back to the cgl kernel
  git checkout cgl

  # rebase the cgl branch to the master
  guilt rebase master

  # this is supposed to simulate a derived kernel picking up
  # patches from standard
