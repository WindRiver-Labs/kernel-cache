# Goal is to migrate all this to standard kernel, once it has
# passed an audit for impact on existing non-mc support.  Files
# marked "MMM" have moved already.

# Start VBI core patches
# MMM patch vbi-introduce-the-vitrual-board-interface-core.patch
# MMM patch wrhv-introduce-the-core-WR-hypervisor-support.patch
# MMM patch x86-wrhv-x86-specifics-of-the-WR-guest-support.patch
# MMM patch powerpc-wrhv-introduce-powerpc-specifics-of-WR-guest.patch
# ---- Split for easy migration from mc to mainline
# MMM patch smp-reloc.patch
# MMM patch ppc-module.patch
# MMM patch wrhv-hrt.patch
# MMM patch hypervisor-boilerplate.patch
# MMM patch hypervisor-dma-changes-for-hypervisor-guest.patch
# ----
# MMM patch x86-core-x86-changes-for-hypervisor-guest.patch
patch powerpc-ppc-core-changes-for-guest-support.patch
# MMM patch mpc8572-board-specific-changes-for-guest-hypervisor.patch
# MMM patch drivers-changes-to-various-drivers-for-hypervisor-gu.patch

# should this be a core patch? It doesn't bump into anything.
# MMM patch documentation-creating-initial-feature-removal-file.patch

# Anything below (MILS exluded) is a fold candidate

# Keep all MILS at the bottom so that it can be easily popped for
# merging in VBI updates, and so it can be dropped as required.
