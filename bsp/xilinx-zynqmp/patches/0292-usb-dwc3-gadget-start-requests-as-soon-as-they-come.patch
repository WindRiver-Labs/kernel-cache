Subject: [PATCH 292/827] usb: dwc3: gadget: start requests as soon as they come

This patch comes from:
  https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx.git

In an attempt to make dwc3 slightly faster, let's
start usb_requests as soon as they come as that will
let us avoid a XFER_NOT_READY event and save a little
bit of time.
