Subject: [PATCH 153/188] phy: zynqmp: Change serdes calibraton logic to
 ICM_CFG1

This patch comes from:
  https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx.git

Because of functional issues in Silicon 1.0 (XCZU9EG) which doesn't
do PMOS calibration properly, software needs to implement work around.

As a software sequence of work around, need to programe any lane to a
valid protocol. Currently serdes driver configures lane 0 (ICM_CFG0) to
PCIe for fixing the above said calibration logic issue.

Currently PCIe doesn't use serdes driver, instead it depends on fsbl for
GT lane initialization. Since serdes driver is reintializing ICM_CFG0,
PCIe is facing link down issues once linux boots.

This patch fixes the above said issue by using ICM_CFG1 instead of ICM_CFG0
for fixing the PMOS calibration issue
