Subject: [PATCH 12/21] Revert "powerpc/85xx: p2020rdb - move the NAND
 address."

commit 4b2e185d23fe76225f64d243a841985dd4f71733 upstream

This reverts commit 0c00f65653389a408dfbbee7578e671664eea26a.
The initial commit was my fault. There are two boards out there:
P2020RDB and P2020RDB-PC. I wasn't aware of that and assumed that I have
a RDB board in front of me while I the RDB-PC. This patch makes it work
for the RDB-PC variant and breaks it for the RDB. Now there is a device
tree file available for the RDB-PC which was not there earlier. So with
this revert, everything gets back to normal :)
