Subject: [PATCH] Avoid memory overwrite when oprofile is used in 64 cores XLP832

The array g_stop_pmc is for all cores to control oprofile sampling.
When invoking "opcontrol --start/--shutdown", all the items
in g_stop_pmc will be written. XLP_MAX_CPUS was defined as 32
previously, it will lead to memory overwriting if the number of
cores exceeds 32.

So, the size of g_stop_pmc should be expanded to support XLP832.
