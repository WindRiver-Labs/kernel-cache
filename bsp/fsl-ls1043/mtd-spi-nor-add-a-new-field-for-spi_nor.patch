Subject: [PATCH 379/451] mtd: spi-nor: add a new field for spi_nor{}

We need the SPI NOR child node to store some specific features, such as the
dummy cycles for the DDR Quad read.
But now, we only have the @dev field in the spi_nor{}. The @dev may points to a
spi_device{} for m25p80, while it may points to a platform_deivice{} for the
SPI NOR controller, such as fsl_quadspi.c.
It is not convenient for us to get come information from the SPI NOR flash.
This patch adds a new field @np to spi_nor{}, it points to the child node for
the SPI NOR flash.
