Subject: [PATCH 388/451] MTD: m25p80: fix inconsistency in m25p_ids compared
 to spi_nor_ids

commit 834b686552d9018e2d17bd56ac5361b78bcc75b8 upstream

As stated in a5b7616c5, "mtd: m25p80,spi-nor: Fix module aliases for
m25p80", m25p_ids[] in m25p80.c needs to be kept in sync with
spi_nor_ids[] in spi-nor.c. The change here corrects a misalignment.

(We were missing m25px80 and we had a duplicate w25q128.)
