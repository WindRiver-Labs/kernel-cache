+The TPS65218 Integrated Power Management Chips.
+These chips are connected to an i2c bus.
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible : Must be "ti,tps65218";
+- interrupts : This i2c device has an IRQ line connected to the main SoC
+- interrupt-controller : Since the tps65218 support several interrupts
+  internally, it is considered as an interrupt controller cascaded to the SoC.
+- #interrupt-cells = <2>;
+- interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.
+
+Optional node:
+- Child nodes contain in the tps65218.
+  It supports a number of features.
+  The children nodes will thus depend of the capability of the variant.
+
+Example:
+/*
+ * Integrated Power Management Chip
+ */
+tps@24 {
+    compatible = "ti,tps65218";
+    reg = <0x24>;
+    interrupt-controller;
+    #interrupt-cells = <2>;
+    interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
+};
