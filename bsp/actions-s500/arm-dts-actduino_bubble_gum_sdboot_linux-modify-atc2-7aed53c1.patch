Subject: [PATCH 1/4] arm: dts: actduino_bubble_gum_sdboot_linux: modify
 atc260x-cap-gauge node

According to experimental result, adjust property value of
atc260x-cap-gauge node for PMIC gauge driver.

Detail reason as below:
capacity property:
There is a typo, in battery spec, the capacity of the battery
of 5300mAh or 5200 mAh, After confirming with hardware partner,
the battery capacity is 5200mAh.

taper_voltage and min_over_chg_protect_voltage property:
according to battery spec, the 2 properties should be set as below:
taper_voltage = <4350>;
min_over_chg_protect_voltage = < 4395 >;
But PMIC vendor also help debug gauge driver, and offer property
value base on their experiment result, and hardware adjust solution.
