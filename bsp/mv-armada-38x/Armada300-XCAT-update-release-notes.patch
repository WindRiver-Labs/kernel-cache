 Note:
 This release has new LSP architecture in order to minimize LSP footprint.
-However, the inception point was release 6.0.1, hence, the list of changes
-if left meanwhile.
-
-- Changes from release 6.0.1
-------------------------------
- o NFP: replaced NFPv1 by NFPv2
- o Fix IGMP support
-   + SWITCH_PORT_CPU array was wrongly accessed with port number instead of
-     switch number
-   + Global qd_dev variable was wrongly used in mv_gw_switch_init()
- o Fix eth port params for link change interrupt
-   + Update mv_eth_set_port_params() to use result of mvBoardMacSpeedGet(),
-     which may be BOARD_MAC_SPEED_AUTO or something specific
- o Fix gateway configuration
-   + mv_gtw_set_mac_addr_to_switch() should get port_bitmap array, not variable
- o Fix SPI Flash partitions
-   + Use CONFIG_MTD_CMDLINE_PARTS instead of CONFIG_MTD_PARTITIONS
-
-- Changes from release 6.0.0
-------------------------------
- o Misc:
-   + Updated default kernel configurations.
-   + Removed old Yukon driver from LSP.
-   + Fixed usbtest module.
-   + Code cleanup.
- o SATA:
-   + Supported Marvell libata native kernel driver.
-   + Fixed several bugs related to NetDMA and Splice.
- o XOR:
-   + Supported 4 XOR channels using Marvell native mv_xor kernel driver.
- o Network:
-   + Aligned several Giga driver APIs with kernel 2.6.36.14 convention.
-
-- Changes from release 5.1.3
-------------------------------
- o LSP ported to Linux Kernel 2.6.35.14.
- o Misc:
-   + Included all bug fixes generated on top of KW LSP 5.1.3.
- o SATA:
-   + Updated default SATA driver to kernel libata(sata_mv).
- o Networking:
-   + Replaced extra buffer allocation per Tx descriptor with per port Extra buffer pool.
-     Number of buffer in this pool defined accordingly with compile-time flags:
-     CONFIG_MV_ETH_EXTRA_BUF_SIZE  + (120) and CONFIG_MV_ETH_EXTRA_BUF_NUM (512).
-   + Support TSO for network interfaces connected to switch.
-   + Added run-time support to enable/disable access of network driver to PNC. New sysfs command is added.
-   + Fixed Rx and Tx coalescing configuration.
-   + Added run-time configuration for RX_WEIGHT - number of packets processed on each NAPI call.
-   + Fixed bug in Tx bytes update for PON port.
-   + Use non cached memory for BM pools (MTU changing crash).
-   + Restrict changing MTU to value under 64 bytes.
-   + Fixed ethtool support.
-   + Added support for mapping different packet types (TCP/UDP/ARP) to different RXQs.
-   + Fixed bug in mapping packet to different RXQs accordingly with TOS (DSCP) value for network
-     interfaces working in promiscuous mode.
-   + Added the following sysfs commands:
-     - "cat                  bm_regs"        - show BM registers
-     - "echo {0|1}      > pnc"               - enable / disable PNC access
-     - "echo p             > gmac_regs"      - show gmac registers for <p>
-     - "echo p txp      > txp_regs"          - show TX registers for <p/txp>
-     - "echo p rxq t   > rxq_type"           - set RXQ for different packet types. t=0-bpdu, 1-arp, 2-tcp, 3-udp
-     - "echo v              > tx_done"       - set threshold to start tx_done operations
-     - "echo p v          > rx_weight"       - set weight for the poll function; <v> - new weight, max val: 255
-
