Subject: [PATCH 007/150] mvebu: dts: enable IP checksum with jumbo frames for
 Armada 38x on Port0

commit c4a25007cfccbf19e6481885af378bca5e681683 upstream.

The Ethernet controller found in the Armada 38x SoC's family support
TCP/IP checksumming with frame sizes larger than 1600 bytes, however
only on port 0.

This commit enables it by setting 'tx-csum-limit' to 9800B in
'ethernet@70000' node.
