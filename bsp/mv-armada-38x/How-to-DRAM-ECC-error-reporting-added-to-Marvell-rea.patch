+================================================
+The following are the steps for enable and use Error Interrupt handler with DRAM ECC reporting.
+    o Enable the feature by next config options:
+        ERROR_HANDLING
+        ERROR_HANDLING_DRAM_ECC
+    This will enable two interrupts handlers and register interrupt reporting mechanism based on netlink socket.
+    o Compile and start user space agent placed under tools/error_handling/.
+    o User space agent will listen on messages from kernel DRAM ECC error reporting mechanism, once ECC error happens and message received - the message will be analyzed and reported on user space level. This is example of user application listening for ECC error messages.
+
+    o Note: The message based on structure that have to be synchronized between kernel interrupt handler and user space agent, so if adding/changing fields reported by kernel, used space agent should be updated.
