+3. Changes from previous releases
+=================================
+Note:

+     which may be BOARD_MAC_SPEED_AUTO or something specific
+ o Fix gateway configuration
+   + mv_gtw_set_mac_addr_to_switch() should get port_bitmap array, not variable

+
+4. Notes
+=========
+NAS:
+- From this version in order to get more optimized results, EXT4 should be used
+  instead of XFS.
+
+Counter/Timer:
+- Due to built-in +/-30 PPM deviation of on-board 25MHz main Xtal, KW
+  internal core clock may drift ~2.5 seconds per day.
+  The +/-30 PPM deviation is according to manufacturer specification.
+
+USB:
+- Linux doesn't handle well a case of 2 ISO devices(full speed) working
+  simultaneously through the high speed hub.
+
+NAND:
+- When working with 4bit ECC configuration, it is not recommended to perform
+  read from an erased page, since no ECC was calculated for this page.
+  In this case we compared the page data against 512 bytes of 0xFF and if we
+  get a match, then return gracefully, otherwise, there is an uncorrectable
+  error.
+  To enable 4bit ECC support in LSP (dynamically), add "nandEcc=4bit" string
+  to U-Boot bootargs.
+
+UBIFS:
+- When UBIFS support is enabled, the kernel configuration option
+  CONFIG_MTD_NAND_VERIFY_WRITE must be disabled, and the CONFIG_NFTL,
+  CONFIG_NFTL_RW options need to be enabled.
+
+TWSI:
+- 2 TWSI drivers are supported within the LSP: based HAL driver and standard Linux
+  driver.
+  The HAL based driver is used by the board environment initialization
+  code (at kernel startup), and upon phone drivers initialization.
+  The Linux driver is being used by the I2S audio codec.
+  In order to use the I2S audio codec the i2c-mv64xxx.ko module should
+  be loaded (after system startup).
+  In a case where both phone and I2S codec drivers should exist in the system,
+  then the Linux I2C module should be loaded (insmod) only after the phone
+  driver is initialized (MMP package is loaded into the system).
+  Additionally, the HAL based driver is not reentrant and can not be used
+  simultaneously by more than one source.
+
+Networking:
+
+- Networking when CPU frequency is low (800MHz) may generate overrun error:
+	" bad rx status 2fc3a86b, (overrun error)".
+
+- NFP doesn't support packets with MTU bigger than 1500 Bytes.
+
+Transport Stream:
+- The transport stream unit driver supports only non-aggregation mode
+  for read and write operations.
+
+Storage:
+- USB VBUS and SDIO WP is not operational on the following boards since
+  it conflicts MPP settings for add-on modules:
+  o DB-88F6281-BP-A: SDIO and USB device
+  o DB-88F6180-BP-A: USB device
+
+- When disconnecting a SATA device while it used by the kernel (e.g. contains
+  unmounted file system), the user must delete the block devices on that
+  channel (using the sysfs), otherwise, farther hotswap events on that channel
+  may cause to kernel crash.
+
+  In order to overcome this issue,
+  We recommend that the user will cleanly remove the scsi dev through the sysfs by using the
+  following command:
+  #echo 1 > /sys/class/scsi_host/hostH/device/targetH:B:T/H:B:T:L/delete
+  Where H, B, T and L stands for Host, Bus, Target and Lun.
+
+  In case that the disk was removed brutally, the udev should detect this event and should remove
+  the device from the sysfs by using the same command as above.
+
+- Thor 6145 has issues with hot-swap, NCQ, port-multiplier and
+  ATAPI support.
+
+- Thor 6121 has issues with hot-swap and ATAPI support.
+
+- This release support up to 512MB of DRAM with current memory layout definition.
+
+Configs:
+- CONFIG_ARM_UNWIND can't be used together with CONFIG_REORDER
