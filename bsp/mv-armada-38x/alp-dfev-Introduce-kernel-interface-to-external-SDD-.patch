Subject: [PATCH 1283/1825] alp: dfev: Introduce kernel interface to external
 SDD Firmware module.

https://github.com/MISL-EBU-System-SW/misl-windriver.git linux-3.4.69-14t2-read
commit 809fc15390871aa57933d4adb0fc8876f42a03ea

	The new interface provides API used by the SDD Firmware
	to access DFEV registers. Also, an access to SoC timer
	is provided.
