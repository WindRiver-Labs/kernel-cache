Subject: [PATCH 017/150] ARM: mvebu: fix description of pwr-sata0 regulator
 on Armada 388 GP

commit b5999dcbdb96570c130772ac2055a4d34ec8b3d7 upstream.

This regulator was lacking the reference to the GPIO that controls it,
and the regulator-min-microvolt and regulator-max-microvolt
properties. Thanks to this commit, the pwr-sata0 regulator now looks
more like the other pwr-sata{1,2,3} regulators in the same Device
Tree, with of course the exception of a different GPIO reference.
