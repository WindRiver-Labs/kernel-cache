Subject: [PATCH 013/150] ARM: mvebu: change the default PCIe apertures for
 Armada 38x

    The latest Marvell bootloaders for various boards added the ability
    to change the L2 filtering area and MBus Window base address
    from 0xC0000000 to 0xF0000000, in order to make more RAM in the first
    4 GB actually usable by the kernel (RAM that is covered by the MBus
    window is "shadowed" and therefore not usable).

    However, our default PCIe memory and I/O apertures where sitting at
    0xe0000000 (for memory) and 0xe8000000 (for I/O), which will now be
    outside of the MBus Window range on those platforms. To make things
    work, we have to ensure those apertures use addresses in the
    0xF0000000 -> 0xFFFFFFFF range.

    We have therefore designed the following memory map:

     * 0xF0000000 -> 0xF1000000: 16 MB, used for NOR flashes when
       supported.

     * 0xF1000000 -> 0xF1100000: 1 MB, used for internal registers.

     * 0xF8000000 -> 0xFFE00000: 126 MB, used for PCIe memory.

     * 0xFFE00000 -> 0xFFF00000: 1 MB, used for PCIe I/O.

     * 0xFFF00000 -> 0xFFFFFFFF: 1 MB, used for the BootROM mapping
