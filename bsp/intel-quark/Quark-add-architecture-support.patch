Subject: [PATCH 1160/1187] Quark: add architecture support.

Quark is a Lakemore based system on chip. This option enables
probing for various PCI-IDs of several on-chip devices. This flag
serves as the high-level dependency for both north-cluster and
south-cluster dependencies associated with Quark.
