Subject: [PATCH 002/173] x86: Don't enable F00F workaround on Intel Quark
 processors

commit d4e1a0af1d3a88cdfc8c954d3005eb8745ec518d upstream.

The Intel Quark processor is a part of family 5, but does not have the
F00F bug present in Pentiums of the same family.

Pentiums were models 0 through 8, Quark is model 9.
