Subject: [PATCH] USB:The fix for Host re-enumeration failure after sleep has
 been added (RTC 112108)

Host re-enumeration fails for few USB2.0 Mass storage devices after sleep,this is due
to the fact that for some mass storage devices time required to complete link training,
after VBUS is powered seems to be high,a similar kind of issue is faced for USB 3.0 and
fix is provided by linux maintainers.The fix is restricted to USB 3.0 devices by adding
a check before timeout.The check for USB 3.0 devices is removed such that the driver will
allow enough time for the device to complete its link training for all USB devices.
