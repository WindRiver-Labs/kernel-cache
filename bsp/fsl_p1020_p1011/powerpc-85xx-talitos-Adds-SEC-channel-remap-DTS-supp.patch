Subject: [PATCH 05/12] powerpc/85xx: talitos: Adds SEC channel remap DTS support

Extracted from the P1020RDB_20100507-ltib.iso vendor drop.

This patch adds the support for remapping the SEC channels to alternate region.
The channel-remap field is a 4-bit bitmap in which a value 0 represents no
remapping and a value 1 means that the channel is remapped to alternate region.

The bitmap is as follows:
0 - Channel 0
1 - Channel 1
2 - Channel 2
3 - Channel 3

A bitmap of 0x3 represents Channel 2 and Channel 3 being remapped.
