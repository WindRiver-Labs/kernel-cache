commit 196f954e250943df414efd3d632254c29be38e59 upstream

This reverts commit 013dd9e03872
("drm/i915/dp: fall back to 18 bpp when sink capability is unknown")

This commit introduced a regression into stable kernels,
as it reduces output color depth to 6 bpc for any video
sink connected to a Displayport connector if that sink
doesn't report a specific color depth via EDID, or if
our EDID parser doesn't actually recognize the proper
bpc from EDID.

Affected are active DisplayPort->VGA converters and
active DisplayPort->DVI converters. Both should be
able to handle 8 bpc, but are degraded to 6 bpc with
this patch.

The reverted commit was meant to fix
Bugzilla: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105331

A followup patch implements a fix for that specific bug,
which is caused by a faulty EDID of the affected DP panel
by adding a new EDID quirk for that panel.

DP 18 bpp fallback handling and other improvements to
DP sink bpc detection will be handled for future
kernels in a separate series of patches.

Please backport to stable.
