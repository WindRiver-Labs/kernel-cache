Subject: [PATCH 1629/4706] drm: Remove unused fbdev_list members

commit 64a9f49c68d1fb4c3a81ce5b57ecb7402ebb8872 from
git://git.yoctoproject.org/linux-yocto-4.1

I noticed that intel_fbdev->our_mode is unused. Introduced by
79e539453b34 ("DRM: i915: add mode setting support").

Then I noticed that intel_fbdev->fbdev_list is unused as well.
Introduced by 386516744ba4 ("drm/fb: fix fbdev object model +
cleanup properly.") in i915, nouveau and radeon.

Subsequently cargo culted to amdgpu, ast, cirrus, qxl, udl,
virtio and mgag200.

Already removed from the latter with cc59487a05b1 ("drm/mgag200:
'fbdev_list' in 'struct mga_fbdev' is not used").

Remove it from the others.
