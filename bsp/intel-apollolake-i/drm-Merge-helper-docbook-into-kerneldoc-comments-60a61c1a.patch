Subject: [PATCH 1857/4706] drm: Merge helper docbook into kerneldoc comments

commit 2be94971c759da872efce99fa823ea17cdb7cc8b upstream

Duplication is bad, luckily both help texts highlighted different
issues so the kerneldoc gained quite a bit!

While at it also sprinkle more references to the vtable structs around
and make it clear that legacy CRTC helpers are deprecated and which
functions to use instead.

v2: Spelling fixes and polish (Thierry).
