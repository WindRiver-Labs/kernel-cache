Subject: [PATCH 0492/4706] drm/i915: Declare the swizzling unknown for
 L-shaped configurations

commit 19ee835cdb0b5a8eb11a68f25a51b8039d564488 upstream

The old style of memory interleaving swizzled upto the end of the
first even bank of memory, and then used the remainder as unswizzled on
the unpaired bank - i.e. swizzling is not constant for all memory. This
causes problems when we try to migrate memory and so the kernel prevents
migration at all when we detect L-shaped inconsistent swizzling.
However, this issue also extends to userspace who try to manually detile
into memory as the swizzling for an individual page is unknown (it
depends on its physical address only known to the kernel), userspace
cannot correctly swizzle objects.

v2: Mark the global swizzling as unknown rather than adjust the value
reported to userspace.
