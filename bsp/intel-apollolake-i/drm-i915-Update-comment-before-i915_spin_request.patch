Subject: [PATCH 3915/4706] drm/i915: Update comment before i915_spin_request

commit 437c30874cb90537e6275f9ed6f6b88307a906a1 upstream

~jiffie and a few usecs is 3 orders of magnitude different. A bit
much. This was changed in

commit ca5b721e238226af1d767103ac852aeb8e4c0764
Author: Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk>

    drm/i915: Limit the busy wait on requests to 5us not 10ms!

But probably missed the comment since the change was non-local to the
comment.

v2: Polish comment more (Chris).
