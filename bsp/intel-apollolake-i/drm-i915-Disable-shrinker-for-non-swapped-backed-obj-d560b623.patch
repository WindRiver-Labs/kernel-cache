Subject: [PATCH 2138/4706] drm/i915: Disable shrinker for non-swapped backed
 objects

commit c1a415e261aad096b3458ba9157fefd123aa7cbf upstream

If the system has no available swap pages, we cannot make forward
progress in the shrinker by releasing active pages, only by releasing
purgeable pages which are immediately reaped. Take total_swap_pages into
account when counting up available objects to be shrunk and subsequently
shrinking them. By doing so, we avoid unbinding objects that cannot be
shrunk and so wasting CPU cycles flushing those objects from the GPU to
the system and then immediately back again (as they will more than
likely be reused shortly after).

Based on a patch by Akash Goel.

v2: frontswap registers extra swap pages available for the system, so it
is already include in the count of available swap pages.

v3: Use get_nr_swap_pages() to query the currently available amount of
swap space. This should also stop us from shrinking the GPU buffers if
we ever run out of swap space. Though at that point, we would expect the
oom-notifier to be running and failing miserably...
