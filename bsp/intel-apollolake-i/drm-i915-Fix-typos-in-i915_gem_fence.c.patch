Subject: [PATCH 2124/4706] drm/i915 Fix typos in i915_gem_fence.c

commit 34fd3e142afb13d22ee4568ae6e151f4d6896c20 upstream

This patch fix some spelling typos found in Documentation/Docbook
gpu/ch04s03.html.  This file was generated from comments within
source, so I have to fix typos in i915_gem_fence.c.
