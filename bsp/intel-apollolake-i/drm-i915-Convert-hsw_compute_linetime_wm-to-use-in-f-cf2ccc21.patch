Subject: [PATCH 2155/4706] drm/i915: Convert hsw_compute_linetime_wm to use
 in-flight state

commit ee91a15972cc70efa4d17b4bbdb61ff314528110 upstream

When watermark calculation was moved up to the atomic check phase, the
code was updated to calculate based on in-flight atomic state rather
than already-committed state.  However the hsw_compute_linetime_wm()
didn't get updated and continued to pull values out of the
currently-committed CRTC state.  On platforms that call this function
(HSW/BDW only), this will cause problems when we go to enable the CRTC
since we'll pull the current mode (off) rather than the mode we're
calculating for and wind up with a divide by zero error.

This was an oversight in commit:
