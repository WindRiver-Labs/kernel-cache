Subject: [PATCH 3466/4706] drm/i915: Removing PCI IDs that are no longer
 listed as Kabylake.

commit a922eb8d4581c883c37ce6e12dca9ff2cb1ea723 upstream

This is unusual. Usually IDs listed on early stages of platform
definition are kept there as reserved for later use.

However these IDs here are not listed anymore in any of steppings
and devices IDs tables for Kabylake on configurations overview
section of BSpec.

So it is better removing them before they become used in any
other future platform.
