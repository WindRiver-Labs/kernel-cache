Subject: [PATCH 1019/4706] drm/i915: disable_shared_pll doesn't work on
 pre-gen5

commit 80aa93128653c5f2502053c0d9740b336d975667 upstream

Looks like

    drm/i915: Update less state during modeset.

introduced the unconditional calling of disable_shared_dpll, but didn't
fix up pre-gen5 to avoid the BUG_ON at the top of the function.

So change the BUG_ON into a gen check (alternately we could move the
BUG_ON until later, since we shouldn't have a pll struct here either,
but this seems clearer to read).

This fixes a crash on load on my x200s platform.
