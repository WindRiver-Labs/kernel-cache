Subject: [PATCH 3137/4706] drm/i915: Rename
 s/skl_compute_pipe_wm/skl_build_pipe_wm/

commit e7649b54777ba6491204acbe1f1a34fce78637d5 upstream

When we added atomic watermarks, we added a new display vfunc
'compute_pipe_wm' that is used to compute any pipe-specific watermark
information that we can at atomic check time.  This was a somewhat poor
naming choice since we already had a 'skl_compute_pipe_wm' function that
doesn't quite fit this model --- the existing SKL function is something
that gets used at atomic commit time, after the DDB allocation has been
determined.  Let's rename the existing SKL function to avoid confusion.
