Subject: [PATCH 4291/4706] drm: Document caveats around atomic event handling

commit 61802130d85fdaf9646340bf1cc64b3e06d0b19c upstream

It's not that obvious how a driver can all race the atomic commit with
handling the completion event. And there's unfortunately a pile of
drivers with rather bad event handling which misdirect people into the
wrong direction.

Try to remedy this by documenting everything better.

v2: Type fixes Alex spotted.

v3: More typos Alex spotted.

+	 *  - For a CRTC which is enabled at the end of the commit (even when it

+	 *    be for the vblank right before the first frame that scans out the
