Subject: [PATCH 4378/4706] drm/i915: Read DPCD when connector forced on.

commit f456c8923b1f3ad510419cfde07084ea0b2be410 from
git://git.yoctoproject.org/linux-yocto-4.1

When a DP connector is forced on using using the video=<connector>:e
kernel command line, we bypass the calls to check if the port is
connected and also bypass the call to intel_dp_detect_dpcd();  The
result is that we don't query for the sink capabilities like the
max link bandwidth.  The sink capabilities are needed to set a
mode.

The solution is to add a call to intel_dp_detect_dpcd() in the code
path for forced on DP connectors.
