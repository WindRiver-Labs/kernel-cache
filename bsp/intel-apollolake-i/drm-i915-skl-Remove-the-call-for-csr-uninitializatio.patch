Subject: [PATCH 1399/4706] drm/i915/skl Remove the call for csr
 uninitialization from suspend path

commit c268444a2cecabc0ab567ca275662d80fa0ac813 upstream

This patch remove the function call to set the firmware
loading status as uninitialized during suspend.

Dmc firmware will restore the firmware in normal suspend. In previous
patch added a check to directly read the hardware status and load
the firmware if got reset during resume from suspend-hibernation.
