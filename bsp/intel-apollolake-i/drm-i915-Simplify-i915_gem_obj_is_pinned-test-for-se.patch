Subject: [PATCH 0161/4706] drm/i915: Simplify i915_gem_obj_is_pinned() test
 for set-tiling

commit 1f30a61482df44ee75c4db73f7f3d70052b93e83 upstream

Since the removal of the user pin_ioctl, the only means for pinning an
object is either through binding to the scanout or during execbuf
reservation. As the later prevents a call to set-tiling, we need only
check if the obj is pinned into the display plane to see if we need
reject the set-tiling ioctl.
