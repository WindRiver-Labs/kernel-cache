Subject: [PATCH 0504/4706] Revert "drm/i915: Declare the swizzling unknown
 for L-shaped configurations"

commit d82c0ba6e306f079407f07003e53c262d683397b upstream

This reverts commit 19ee835cdb0b5a8eb11a68f25a51b8039d564488.

It breaks existing old userspace which doesn't handle UNKNOWN
swizzling correct. Yes UNKNOWN was a thing back in 2009 and probably
still is on some other platforms, but it still pretty clearly broke
the testers machine. If we want this we need to extend the ioctl with
new paramters that only new userspace looks at.
