Subject: [PATCH 0108/4706] drm/i915: Preserve scaler state when clearing
 crtc_state

commit 663a36407a71b3a98cea087f9a215660a6d6e387 upstream

crtc_state is cleared during mode set which wipes out complete
scaler state too. This is causing issues. To fix, ensure scaler
state is preserved because it contains not only crtc
scaler usage, but also planes using scalers on this crtc.
