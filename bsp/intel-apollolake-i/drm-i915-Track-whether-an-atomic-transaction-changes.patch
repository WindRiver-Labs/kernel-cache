Subject: [PATCH 1392/2508] drm/i915: Track whether an atomic transaction
 changes the active CRTC's

commit 8b4a7d0597cd9910d7127ffae6ae91d21853a8a2 upstream

For the purposes of DDB re-allocation we need to know whether a
transaction changes the list of CRTC's that are active.  While
state->modeset could be used for this purpose, that would be slightly
too aggressive since it would lead us to re-allocate the DDB when a
CRTC's mode changes, but not its final active state.
