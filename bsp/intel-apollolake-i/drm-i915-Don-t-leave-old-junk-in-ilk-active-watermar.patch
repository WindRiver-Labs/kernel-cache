Subject: [PATCH 2968/4706] drm/i915: Don't leave old junk in ilk active
 watermarks on readout
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

commit 15606534bf0a65d8a74a90fd57b8712d147dbca6 upstream

When we read out the watermark state from the hardware we're supposed to
transfer that into the active watermarks, but currently we fail to any
part of the active watermarks that isn't explicitly written. Let's clear
it all upfront.

Looks like this has been like this since the beginning, when I added the
readout. No idea why I didn't clear it up.
