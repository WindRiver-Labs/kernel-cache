Subject: [PATCH 0928/2508] drm/i915/fbc: don't store/check a pointer to the
 FB

commit 9b42281f9ddafe459e0b0d91ddf1939fbf84d832 upstream

We already make sure we run intel_fbc_update_update during modesets
and page flips, and this function takes care of deactivating FBC, so
it shouldn't be possible for us to reach the condition we check at
intel_fbc_work_fn. So instead of grabbing framebuffer references and
adding a lot of code to track when we need to free them, just don't
track anything at all since we shouldn't need to.

v2: Rebase.
