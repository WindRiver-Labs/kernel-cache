Subject: [PATCH 0719/2508] drm: Fix treatment of drm_vblank_offdelay in
 drm_vblank_on() (v2)

commit bb74fc1bf3072bd3ab4ed5f43afd287a63baf2d7 upstream

drm_vblank_offdelay can have three different types of values:

< 0 is to be always treated the same as dev->vblank_disable_immediate
= 0 is to be treated as "never disable vblanks"
> 0 is to be treated as disable immediate if kms driver wants it
    that way via dev->vblank_disable_immediate. Otherwise it is
    a disable timeout in msecs.

This got broken in Linux 3.18+ for the implementation of
drm_vblank_on. If the user specified a value of zero which should
always reenable vblank irqs in this function, a kms driver could
override the users choice by setting vblank_disable_immediate
to true. This patch fixes the regression and keeps the user in
control.

v2: Only reenable vblank if there are clients left or the user
    requested to "never disable vblanks" via offdelay 0. Enabling
    vblanks even in the "delayed disable" case (offdelay > 0) was
    specifically added by Ville in commit cd19e52aee922
    ("drm: Kick start vblank interrupts at drm_vblank_on()"),
    but after discussion it turns out that this was done by accident.

    Citing Ville: "I think it just ended up as a mess due to changing
    some of the semantics of offdelay<0 vs. offdelay==0 vs.
    disable_immediate during the review of the series. So yeah, given
    how drm_vblank_put() works now, I'd just make this check for
    offdelay==0."
