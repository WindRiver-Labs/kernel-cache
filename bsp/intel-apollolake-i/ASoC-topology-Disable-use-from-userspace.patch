Subject: [PATCH 1600/2508] ASoC: topology: Disable use from userspace

commit 8c90503bf246bebb48caa5590d41df755ba08550 upstream

Since the topology API is still in sufficient flux for changes to be
identified disable the use of the userspace ABI by adding #error
statements to the code, ensuring that nobody relies on the headers as
currently defined.  It is expected that this change will be reverted for
v4.3.
