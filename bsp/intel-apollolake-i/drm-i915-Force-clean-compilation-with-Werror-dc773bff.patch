Subject: [PATCH 2808/4706] drm/i915: Force clean compilation with -Werror

commit f88e6f0539a7e6ed7bb11fa7b45e289e6cafd085 from
git://git.yoctoproject.org/linux-yocto-4.1

Our driver compiles clean (nowadays thanks to 0day) but for me, at least,
it would be beneficial if the compiler threw an error rather than a
warning when it found a piece of suspect code. (I use this to
compile-check patch series and want to break on the first compiler error
in order to fix the patch.)

v2: Kick off a new "Debugging" submenu for i915.ko

At this point, we applied it to the kernel and promptly kicked it out
again as it broke buildbots (due to a compiler warning on 32bits):

    Revert "drm/i915: Force clean compilation with -Werror"

v3: Avoid enabling -Werror for allyesconfig/allmodconfig builds, using
COMPILE_TEST as a suitable proxy suggested by Andrew Morton. (Damien)
Only make the option available for EXPERT to reinforce that the option
should not be casually enabled.
