Subject: [PATCH 177/203] drm/vc4: Don't force new binner overflow allocation
 per draw.

This came from the initial bringup code, which always idled the GPU
and always reset the overflow.  That massively increases the size of
the working set when you're doing lots of small draws, though, as is
common on X desktops or piglit.
