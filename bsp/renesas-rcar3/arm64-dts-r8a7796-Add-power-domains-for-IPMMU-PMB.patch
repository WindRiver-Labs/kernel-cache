Subject: [PATCH 1624/2066] arm64: dts: r8a7796: Add power domains for IPMMU
 (PMB)

As the power domains have to be enabled before accessing to
IPMMU registers and there's a usecase that MMNGR will configure IPMMU
(PMB) for Multimedia features,
this patch registers corresponding power domains for targeted IPMMU(s).
