Subject: [PATCH 0141/2066] i2c: apply address offset for slaves, too

upstream da899f55b359225f85e154765baaddb13ec436ca commit

We want a separate address range for being an I2C slave. Add an offset
of 0x1000, so it can be combined with ten bit addresses as well. Add a
separate function to create the address value, we will need it later in
other places.
