Subject: [PATCH 1040/2066] clk: shmobile: r8a7778: Add CPG/MSTP Clock Domain
 support

upstream 8bc964aa25e56b7445ffebffccd455f959370a16 commit

Add Clock Domain support to the R-Car M1A Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)
driver using the generic PM Domain.  This allows to power-manage the
module clocks of SoC devices that are part of the CPG/MSTP Clock Domain
using Runtime PM, or for system suspend/resume.

SoC devices that are part of the CPG/MSTP Clock Domain and can be
power-managed through an MSTP clock should be tagged in DT with a proper
"power-domains" property.
