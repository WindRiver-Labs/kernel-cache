Subject: [PATCH 1962/2066] i2c: rcar: use adapter default for timeout

upstream efd2c6118e49152bea891706432ac3c9579836fe commit

5 seconds is a very large timeout, and it is hardcoded. Use the default
timeout from 'struct adapter' which is 1 second. It can also be modified
from userspace for specific workloads via i2c-dev.
