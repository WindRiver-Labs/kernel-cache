Subject: [PATCH 1003/2066] arm64: dts: r8a7795: remove unnecessary
 cap-mmc-highspeed property

upstream 56de959f533f5138f1cd5aaa4706e1831c479e28 commit

Remove cap-mmc-highspeed property from SDHI2 and SDHI3.

This property is unnecessary as the driver automatically sets
the highspeed capability. Furthermore its use is inconsistent with SDHI0
and SDHI1 which are also highspeed capable but do not have this property
present.

Found by inspection.
