Subject: [PATCH 0538/2066] PCI: rcar: Add device tree support for r8a7793

upstream 0cf1337e0b83c16de4e7e98dad3a6afce6043fea commit

Add "renesas,pcie-r8a7793" as a compatibility string for
"renesas,pcie-rcar-gen2".

This doesn't change the driver, so it does nothing by itself.  But it
does mean that checkpatch won't complain about a future patch that adds
"renesas,pci-r8a7793" to a DT, which helps ensure that shipped DTs use
documented compatibility strings.
