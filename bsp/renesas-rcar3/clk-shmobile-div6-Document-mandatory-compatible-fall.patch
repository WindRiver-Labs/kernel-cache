Subject: [PATCH 0054/2066] clk: shmobile: div6: Document mandatory compatible
 fallback

upstream 370626288f1a5992951abf825c4b662ba55774c0 commit

The generic CPG DIV6 clock compatible value is mandatory, as the driver
uses only this value for matching.  Document that this is a fallback
that must be present.
