Subject: [PATCH 0718/2066] bus: simple-pm-bus: Use ARCH_RENESAS

upstream 41feae79f2621d9fcea1437d4a2f29dc731fdbb0 commit

Make use of ARCH_RENESAS in place of ARCH_SHMOBILE.

This is part of an ongoing process to migrate from ARCH_SHMOBILE to
ARCH_RENESAS the motivation for which being that RENESAS seems to be a more
appropriate name than SHMOBILE for the majority of Renesas ARM based SoCs.
