Subject: [PATCH 1769/2066] arm64: dts: r8a7795-salvator-xs: Add I2C ch4
 device support

This patch adds I2C ch4 devices support for Salvator-X 2nd version board
on R8A7795 ES2.0 SoC. This pinctrl of I2C ch4 is unnecessary.

The default I2C bus clock rate of I2C ch4 sets 400 kHz. Each following
I2C device on the board connected to I2C ch4 is supporting the bus clock
of 400 kHz:

    PCA9654, 9FGV0841, ADV7482WBBCZ, MAX9611, 5P49V6901
