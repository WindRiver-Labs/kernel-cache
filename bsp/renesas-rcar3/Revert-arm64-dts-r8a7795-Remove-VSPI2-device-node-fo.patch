Subject: [PATCH 1733/2066] Revert "arm64: dts: r8a7795: Remove VSPI2 device
 node for VSP2 Driver"

This reverts commit 8fb7933337eb ("arm64: dts: r8a7795: Remove VSPI2
device node for  VSP2 Driver").

Since VSPI2 unit was deleted as R8A7795 ES2.0 SoC, 'vsp@fe9c0000' device
node should have been deleted, but this reverted commit has deleted
'vsp@fe920000' node.

The patch which deletes the intended device node is added later.
