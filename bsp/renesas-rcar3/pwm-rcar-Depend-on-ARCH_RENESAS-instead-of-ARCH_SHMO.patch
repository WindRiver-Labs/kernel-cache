Subject: [PATCH 0713/2066] pwm: rcar: Depend on ARCH_RENESAS instead of
 ARCH_SHMOBILE

upstream 03d99531aed486f9e7020da3810102df1b91cd34 commit

This is part of an ongoing process to migrate from ARCH_SHMOBILE to
ARCH_RENESAS the motivation for which being that RENESAS seems to be a
more appropriate name than SHMOBILE for the majority of Renesas ARM
based SoCs.
