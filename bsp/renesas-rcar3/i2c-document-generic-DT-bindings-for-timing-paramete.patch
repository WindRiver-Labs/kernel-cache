Subject: [PATCH 0433/2066] i2c: document generic DT bindings for timing
 parameters

upstream 99b809d7bdd17de7a68f1625a8973052c8311657 commit

Also, sort the properties alphabetically and make indentation
consistent. Wording largely taken from i2c-rk3x.txt, thanks guys!

Only "i2c-scl-internal-delay-ns" is new, the rest is used by two drivers
already and was documented in their driver binding documentation.
