Subject: [PATCH 421/435] drm/i915: increase the tries for HDMI hotplug live
 status checking

commit '3d8acd1f667b45c531401c8f0c2033072e32a05d' upstream

The total delay of HDMI hotplug detecting with 30ms is sometimes not
enoughtfor HDMI live status up with specific HDMI monitors in BSW platform.

After doing experiments for following monitors, it needs 80ms at least
for those worst cases.

Lenovo L246 1xwA (4 failed, necessary hot-plug delay: 58/40/60/40ms)
Philips HH2AP (9 failed, necessary hot-plug delay: 80/50/50/60/46/40/58/58/39ms)
BENQ ET-0035-N (6 failed, necessary hot-plug delay: 60/50/50/80/80/40ms)
DELL U2713HM (2 failed, necessary hot-plug delay: 58/59ms)
HP HP-LP2475w (5 failed, necessary hot-plug delay: 70/50/40/60/40ms)

It looks like 70-80 ms is BSW platform needs in some bad cases of the
monitors at this end (8 times delay at most). Keep less than 100ms for
HDCP pulse HPD low (with at least 100ms) to respond a plug out.
