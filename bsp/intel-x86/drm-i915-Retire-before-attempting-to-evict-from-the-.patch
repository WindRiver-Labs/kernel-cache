Subject: [PATCH 2235/4301] drm/i915: Retire before attempting to evict from
 the active lists

commit 7155b057c61e55eed27bf478ac9b8034c4c97582 upstream

Some object retain an extra pin whilst they are active (e.g. contexts).
This excludes them from being considered for eviction unless we idle the
GPU. If before we look at the active list, we retire beforehand we can
hopefully remove a few excess pins and reduce the amount of searching
required.

v2: Similar principle applies to evict_for_vma
