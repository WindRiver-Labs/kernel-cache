Subject: [PATCH 2213/4301] drm/i915/guc: Drop comment on fwif autogeneration

commit c499af5a692fa39644ce7979b4dea5db794df78b upstream

The firmware interface file was initially partially autogenerated, but
this is no longer the case.

It was never updated automatically, and a lot manual changes were
introduced since.

>From now on any changes to the firmware interface will be managed by
hand, which gives us flexibility when it comes to structure reuse
(HuC/GuC) and naming conventions.
