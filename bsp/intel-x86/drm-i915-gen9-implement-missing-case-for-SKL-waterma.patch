Subject: [PATCH 1199/4301] drm/i915/gen9: implement missing case for SKL
 watermarks calculation

commit f1db3eafe5a2ad39caa8315f9b5403759e0c5520 upstream

This should affect linear and X tiled planes on really small htotal
cases. It doesn't seem to be a very feasible case, but let's implement
it since it's on the specification and it's better to have it and
never need than not have it and realize we needed it.
