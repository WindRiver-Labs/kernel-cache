Subject: [PATCH 1726/4301] drm/i915: Avoid early GPU idling due to race with
 new request

commit 93c97dc17ffc4a0651b5a939d1ef34897513b252 upstream

There is a small race where a new request can be submitted and retired
after the idle worker started to run which leads to idling the GPU too
early. Fix this by deferring the idling to the pending instance of the
worker.

This scenario was pointed out by Chris.
