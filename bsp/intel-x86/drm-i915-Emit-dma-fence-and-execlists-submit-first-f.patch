Subject: [PATCH 2826/4301] drm/i915: Emit dma-fence (and execlists submit)
 first from signaler

commit 7c9e934ef8a09a1a42f15ce9f0f872fdfdb67b97 upstream

When introduced, I thought that reducing client latency from the
signaler was the priority. Since its inception the signaler has become
responsible for keeping the execlists full, via the dma-fence. As this
is very important to minimise overall execution time, signal the
dma-fence first and then signal any waiting clients.
