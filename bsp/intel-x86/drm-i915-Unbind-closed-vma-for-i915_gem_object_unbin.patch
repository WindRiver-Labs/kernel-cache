Subject: [PATCH 0372/4301] drm/i915: Unbind closed vma for
 i915_gem_object_unbind()

commit 02bef8f98d26e9774b49c78a42b29b168e8876fc upstream

Closed vma are removed from the obj->vma_list so that they cannot be
found by userspace. However, this means that when forcibly unbinding an
object, we have to wait upon all rendering to that object first in order
for the closed, but active, vma to be reaped and their bindings removed.

Bugzilla: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97343
Fixes: aa653a685d81 ("drm/i915: Be more careful when unbinding vma")
Fixes: 8a3b3d576c93 (" drm/i915: Convert non-blocking userptr waits...")
