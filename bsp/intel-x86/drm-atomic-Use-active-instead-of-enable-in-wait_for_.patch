Subject: [PATCH 2500/4301] drm/atomic: Use active instead of enable in
 wait_for_vblanks.

commit 7da0e124af76c79927f0d7abcc58d58d0fd7072f upstream

When DPMS was introduced to atomic, vblanks only worked when the crtc
was enabled and active. wait_for_vblanks were not converted to check for
crtc_state->active, which may cause an attempt for vblank_get to fail.

This is probably harmless, but convert from enable to active anyway.
