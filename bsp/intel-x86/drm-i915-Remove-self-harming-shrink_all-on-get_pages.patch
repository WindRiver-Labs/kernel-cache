Subject: [PATCH 1235/4301] drm/i915: Remove self-harming shrink_all on
 get_pages_gtt fail

commit 465350d0db06e280dfd7998392269358bba30813 upstream

When we notice the system under memory pressure, we try to evict some
driver pages before asking the VM to shrink all caches. As a final step
in that process, we tried to evict everything, including active buffers.
This is harming ourselves, and we can mix shrinking all caches as well
as our residual buffers (after the first pass of trying to shrink just
our own buffers).
