Subject: [PATCH 3675/4301] ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Use DPIB to update position
 for Playback stream

commit 9a58725ba533b46db31d10a6dcc5ab7f9fa370ed upstream

DPIB is read currently from a buffer position in memory (indicated by
the registers DPIB[U|L]BASE).Driver reads the position buffer on BDL
completion interrupts to report the DMA position. But the BDL completion
interrupt only indicates the last DMA transfer of the buffer is
completed at the Intel HD Audio subsystem boundary. The periodic DMA
Position-in-Buffer writes may be scheduled at the same time or later
than the MSI and does not guarantee to reflect the position of the last
buffer that was transferred.

Whereas DPIB register in HDA space(vendor specific register indicated by
SDxDPIB) reflects the actual data that is transferred. Hence update the
position based on DPIB for playback.
