Subject: [PATCH 2944/4301] drm/bridge: adv7511: Re-write the i2c address
 before EDID probing

commit 3587c856675c45809010c2cee5b21096f6e8e938 upstream

I've found that by just turning the chip on and off via the
POWER_DOWN register, I end up getting i2c_transfer errors on
HiKey.

Investigating further, it turns out that some of the register
state in hardware is getting lost, as the device registers are
reset when the chip is powered down.

Thus this patch simply re-writes the i2c address to the
ADV7511_REG_EDID_I2C_ADDR register to ensure its properly set
before we try to read the EDID data.
