Subject: [PATCH 3107/4301] drm/i915: Flush untouched framebuffers before
 display on !llc

commit 69aeafeae9b30d797c439a30d1a4ccc8dc5b0eb0 upstream

On a non-llc system, the objects are created with .cache_level =
CACHE_NONE and so the transition to uncached for scanout is a no-op.
However, if the object was never written to, it will still be in the CPU
domain (having been zeroed out by shmemfs). Those cachelines need to be
flushed prior to display.

Reported-and-tested-by: Vito Caputo
Fixes: a6a7cc4b7db6 ("drm/i915: Always flush the dirty CPU cache when pinning the scanout")
