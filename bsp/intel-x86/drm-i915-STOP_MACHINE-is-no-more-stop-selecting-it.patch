Subject: [PATCH 1331/4301] drm/i915: STOP_MACHINE is no more, stop selecting
 it
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 38fac8bffca212e932f306c4a27e5b35d3c29419 upstream

The STOP_MACHINE kconfig symbol was removed upstream after making
stop_machine() always work, commit 86fffe4a61dd ("kernel: remove
stop_machine() Kconfig dependency"), and was removed from i915's Kconfig
in commit 21fabbebff0e ("drm/i915: Remove select to deleted
STOP_MACHINE from Kconfig").

However, I accidentally reintroduced the select when rebasing an older
commit that also was dependent upon a working stop_machine.

Fixes: 9f267eb8d2ea ("drm/i915: Stop the machine whilst capturing...")
