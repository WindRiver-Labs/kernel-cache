Subject: [PATCH 0447/4301] drm/i915: Remember to set vma->pages for the
 preallocated stolen object

commit dbaf788e710d1f65340c5f46a706fee5b634493c upstream

In commit 247177ddd517 ("drm/i915: Always set the vma->pages"), as it
title implies, we always set vma->pages for bound objects. Even before
that, we would set vma->ggtt_view.pages, for globally bound objects.
This was forgotten for the fixup inside the preallocated stolen objects,
which has to recreate a global GTT binding outside of the usual VMA
insertion path
