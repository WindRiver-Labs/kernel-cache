Subject: [PATCH 0051/4301] drm/i915: Remove misleading CSR firmware loading
 docs

commit 843759a5f81d0b65df12f3bb6627fc7c3e450a98 upstream

I forgot to remove these when reworking the firmware loading sequence
last year. The new sequence is that we load firmware, and if it's not
there we entirely (and permanently) fail dmc setup.
