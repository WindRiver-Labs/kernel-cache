Subject: [PATCH 3723/4301] ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Fix DMA position reporting
 for capture stream

commit fdd85a054b850db43c6abe39c1da28b581be5e93 upstream

As per hardware recommendation, for every capture stream completion
following operations need to be done in order to reflect the actual
data that is received in position buffer.

1. Wait for 20us before reading the DMA position in buffer once the
interrupt is generated for stream completion.
2. Read any of the register to flush the DMA position value. This is
dummy read operation.
