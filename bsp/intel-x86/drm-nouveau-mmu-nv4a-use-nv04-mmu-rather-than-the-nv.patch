Subject: [PATCH 3643/4301] drm/nouveau/mmu/nv4a: use nv04 mmu rather than the
 nv44 one

commit f94773b9f5ecd1df7c88c2e921924dd41d2020cc upstream

The NV4A (aka NV44A) is an oddity in the family. It only comes in AGP
and PCI varieties, rather than a core PCIE chip with a bridge for
AGP/PCI as necessary. As a result, it appears that the MMU is also
non-functional. For AGP cards, the vast majority of the NV4A lineup,
this worked out since we force AGP cards to use the nv04 mmu. However
for PCI variants, this did not work.

Switching to the NV04 MMU makes it work like a charm. Thanks to mwk for
the suggestion. This should be a no-op for NV4A AGP boards, as they were
using it already.
