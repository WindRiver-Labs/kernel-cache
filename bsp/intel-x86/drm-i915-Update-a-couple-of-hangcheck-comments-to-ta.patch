Subject: [PATCH 0063/4301] drm/i915: Update a couple of hangcheck comments to
 talk about engines

commit 9930ca1ae7e9fbf67e3a69239e9a39e80f4d9f60 upstream

We still have lots of comments that refer to the old ring when we mean
struct intel_engine_cs and its hardware correspondence. This patch fixes
an instance inside hangcheck to talk about engines.
