Subject: [PATCH 2309/4301] drm/i915: Update comment in vlv_set_rps_idle()
MIME-Version: 1.0

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit c9efef7bd91ff131dc87838372c5dd40b3de9099 upstream

Ville explained that the wakelock was being acquired during set-idle in
order to flush the voltage change from the punit.
