Subject: [PATCH 1568/4301] dma-buf/sync_file: hold reference to fence when
 creating sync_file

commit 30cd85dd6edc86ea8d8589efb813f1fad41ef233 upstream

fence referencing was out of balance. It was not taking any ref to the
fence at creating time, but it was putting a reference when freeing the
sync file.

This patch fixes the balancing issue by getting a reference for the fence
when creating the sync_file.
