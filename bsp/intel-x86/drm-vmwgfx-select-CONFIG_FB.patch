Subject: [PATCH 0367/4301] drm/vmwgfx: select CONFIG_FB

commit 183cd49f1da039c791fa7e3d935c873ee4c47fd2 upstream

vmwgfx doesn't actually build without that.

It would be great if vmwgfx could switch over to the fbdev emulation
helpers, since those will take care of all this already. I guess one
reason to not do that was lack of defio support in the helpers, but
that's fixed now. If there's any other hold-up, we should figure out
what it is and whether it makes sense to address it.
