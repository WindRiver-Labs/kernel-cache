Subject: [PATCH 2129/4301] drm: Nerf DRM_CONTROL nodes

commit 8a357d10043c75e980e7fcdb60d2b913491564af upstream

Looking at the ioctl permission checks I noticed that it's impossible
to import gem buffers into a control nodes, and fd2handle/handle2fd
also don't work, so no joy with dma-bufs.

The only way to do anything with a control node is by drawing stuff
into a dumb buffer and displaying that. I suspect control nodes are an
entirely unused thing, and a cursory check shows that there does not
seem to be any callers of drmOpenControl nor of the other drmOpen
functions using DRM_MODE_CONTROL.

Since I don't like dead uabi, let's remove it. But since this would be
a really big change I think it's better to start out small by simply
not registering anything. We can garbage-collect the dead code later
on, once we're sure it's really not used anywhere.
