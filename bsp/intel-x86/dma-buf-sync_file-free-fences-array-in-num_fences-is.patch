Subject: [PATCH 1574/4301] dma-buf/sync_file: free fences array in num_fences
 is 1

commit c654dd07522e88bacc546c9ccd81b3ee72838ccf upstream

When merging sync_files there is a case when we can end up with only one
fence in the merged sync_file: when all fences belong to the same
timeline.

So for this case a fence_array is not created instead we just assigned the
fence to sync_file->fence. Then we do not use the fences array anymore nor
does free it.

This patch frees the array.
