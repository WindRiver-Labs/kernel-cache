Subject: [PATCH 2561/4301] drm/vmwgfx: use designated initializers

commit 5ca16d8efa669a7b57b85d9d6aa49b001ba79afb upstream

Prepare to mark sensitive kernel structures for randomization by making
sure they're using designated initializers. These were identified during
allyesconfig builds of x86, arm, and arm64, with most initializer fixes
extracted from grsecurity.
