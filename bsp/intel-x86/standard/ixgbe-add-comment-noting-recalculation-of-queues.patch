Subject: [PATCH 154/348] ixgbe: add comment noting recalculation of queues

commit eec66731de41643c9752cccb54b9b1830039a5e9 upstream.

Since we previously called ixgbe_set_num_queues just prior to attempting
to set our interrupt scheme, it may be non obvious why we have to call
it again inside the function. Add a comment which helps make it more
obvious that we are resetting features based on the fact that we do not
have MSI-X enabled, and cannot use the previous settings.
