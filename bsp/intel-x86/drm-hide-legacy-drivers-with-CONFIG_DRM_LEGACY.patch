Subject: [PATCH 0584/4301] drm: hide legacy drivers with CONFIG_DRM_LEGACY

commit d92d9c3a14488e5af9d7015189f50e02346950f2 upstream

Lets move forward and hide the remaining DRI1 drivers behind a config
option, so we have a central place to disable them all. Furthermore, we
can provide a clear warning to anyone enabling them.
