Subject: [PATCH 0149/4301] drm/i915: Convert 4096 alignment request to 0 for
 drm_mm allocations

commit 954c4691218d9e3736dec089c0a5546391c8f3df upstream

As we always allocate in chunks of 4096 (that being both the PAGE_SIZE
and our own GTT_PAGE_SIZE), we know that all results from the drm_mm are
aligned to at least 4096. The drm_mm allocator itself is optimised for
alignment == 0, and so by converting alignments of 4096 to 0 we can
satisfy our own requirements and still hit the faster path.
