Subject: [PATCH 2270/4301] drm/i915: Add a test that we terminate the trimmed
 sgtable as expected

commit c2dc6cc946aa8463e1e7676c8f82334c1dc8a01c upstream

In commit 0c40ce130e38 ("drm/i915: Trim the object sg table"), we expect
to copy exactly orig_st->nents across and allocate the table thusly.
The copy loop should therefore end with the new_sg being NULL.
