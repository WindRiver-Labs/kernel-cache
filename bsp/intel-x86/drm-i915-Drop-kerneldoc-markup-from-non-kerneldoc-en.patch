Subject: [PATCH 2305/4301] drm/i915: Drop kerneldoc markup from non-kerneldoc
 enum drrs_refresh_rate_type

commit fe88d122e6aeb86b3bffc76a997ce439cb6f031a upstream

DRRS is not yet kerneldoc despite the allusion prior to enum
drrs_refresh_rate_type. Drop the '**' to avoid the warnings from
make htmldocs.
