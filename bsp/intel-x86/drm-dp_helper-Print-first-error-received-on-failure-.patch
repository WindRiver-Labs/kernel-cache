Subject: [PATCH 0313/4301] drm/dp_helper: Print first error received on
 failure in drm_dp_dpcd_access()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit 29f21e0491819d05d28b4a1f7a5b7e68f802c60b upstream

Since we always retry in drm_dp_dpcd_access() regardless of the error,
we're going to make a lot of noise if the aux->transfer function prints
it's own errors (as is the case with radeon). If we can print the error
code here, this reduces the need for drivers to do this. So instead of
having to print "dp_aux_ch timed out" over 32 times we can just print
once.
