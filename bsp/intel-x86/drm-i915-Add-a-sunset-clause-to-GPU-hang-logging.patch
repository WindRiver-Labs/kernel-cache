Subject: [PATCH 1339/4301] drm/i915: Add a sunset clause to GPU hang logging

commit eafc4894d0a6a773970b40dd092dbc0771ed39b5 upstream

If the kernel is old, more than a few releases old, chances are that the
user is using an old kernel for a good reason, despite there being GPU
hangs. After 180days since driver release stop suggesting that they
should send those reports upstream.

[Since Daniel acked this I expect he will pick up the dim patch to
automatically update the DRIVER_TIMESTAMP everytime we tag a new
release.]
