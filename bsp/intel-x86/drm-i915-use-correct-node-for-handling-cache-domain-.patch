Subject: [PATCH 3495/4301] drm/i915: use correct node for handling cache
 domain eviction

commit fe65cbdbc97929e4a522716ed279a36783656142 upstream

It looks like we were incorrectly comparing vma->node against itself
instead of the target node, when evicting for a node on systems where we
need guard pages between regions with different cache domains. As a
consequence we can end up trying to needlessly evict neighbouring nodes,
even if they have the same cache domain, and if they were pinned we
would fail the eviction.
