Subject: [PATCH 0029/4301] drm/i915: Retire oldest completed request before
 allocating next

commit 9b5f4e5ed6fd58390ecad3772b80936357f1aba6 upstream

In order to keep the memory allocated for requests reasonably tight, try
to reuse the oldest request (so long as it is completed and has no
external references) for the next allocation.

v2: Throw in a comment to hopefully make sure no one mistakes the
optimistic retirement of the oldest request for simply stealing it.
