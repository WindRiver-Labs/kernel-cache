Subject: [PATCH 0030/4301] drm/i915: Mark all current requests as complete
 before resetting them

commit c4b0930bf418d5fab1d75ab462f0a7ff155f1b33 upstream

Following a GPU reset upon hang, we retire all the requests and then
mark them all as complete. If we mark them as complete first, we both
keep the normal retirement order (completed first then retired) and
provide a small optimisation for concurrent lookups.
