Subject: [PATCH 0025/4301] drm/i915: Clean up kerneldoc for intel_lrc.c

commit 6e5248b53fda0dc61227b1c560897beb36d22225 upstream

Fairly minimal, there's still lots of functions without any docs, and
which aren't static. But probably we want to first clean this up some more.

- Drop the bogus const. Marking argument pointers themselves (instead of
  what they point at) as const provides roughly 0 value. And it's confusing,
  since the data the pointer points at _is_ being changed.

- Remove kerneldoc for static functions. Keep comments where they seem valuable.

- Indent and whitespace fixes.

- Blockquote the bit field definitions of the descriptor for correct layouting.
