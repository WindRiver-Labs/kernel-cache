Subject: [PATCH 1781/4301] drm/i915: Give each sw_fence its own lockclass

commit 556b748710586afa24a696ba81fe89dc7f41cebd upstream

Localise the static struct lock_class_key to the caller of
i915_sw_fence_init() so that we create a lock_class instance for each
unique sw_fence rather than all sw_fences sharing the same
lock_class. This eliminate some lockdep false positive when using fences
from within fence callbacks.

For the relatively small number of fences currently in use [2], this adds
160 bytes of unused text/code when lockdep is disabled. This seems
quite high, but fully reducing it via ifdeffery is also quite ugly.
Removing the #fence strings saves 72 bytes with just a single #ifdef.
