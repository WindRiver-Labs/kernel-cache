Subject: [PATCH 142/198] x86/MCE/AMD: Fix thinko about thresholding_en

commit 254fe9c7a4187ebf5ce23e0ca0e9ba98b1dbef18 upstream.

So adding thresholding_en et al was a good thing for removing the
per-CPU thresholding callback, i.e., threshold_cpu_callback.

But, in order for it to work and especially that test in
mce_threshold_create_device() so that all thresholding banks get
properly created and not the whole thing to fail with a NULL ptr
dereference at mce_cpu_pre_down() when we offline the CPUs, we need to
set the thresholding_en flag *before* we start creating the devices.

Yap, it failed because thresholding_en wasn't set at the time
we were creating the banks so we didn't create any and then at
mce_cpu_pre_down() -> mce_threshold_remove_device() time, we would blow
up.

And the fix is actually easy: we have thresholding on the system when we
have managed to set the thresholding vector to amd_threshold_interrupt()
earlier in mce_amd_feature_init() while we were picking apart the
thresholding banks and what is set and what not.

So let's do that.
