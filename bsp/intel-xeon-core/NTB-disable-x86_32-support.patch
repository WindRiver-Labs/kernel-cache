Subject: [PATCH 20/70] NTB: disable x86_32 support

Upstream: 719234f9444552a8b3ac30a7c373db62e13c14f4

Atomic readq and writeq do not exist by default on some 32bit
architectures, thus causing compile errors due to non-existent symbols.
Since NTB has not been tested 32bit, disable x86_32 support until such
time as this and any other issues can be properly discovered.
