Subject: [PATCH 215/609] ARM: OMAP2+: am335x: Correct pin-mux string for MMC0

Original commit: 7f1420dcf89ef5ca81ad525b5e4059edd2497d7e

  From git://arago-project.org/git/projects/linux-am33x.git
  And ti-sdk-am335x-evm-05.05.00.00-Linux-x86-Install image

GPIO pin was used for Card detect signal for MMC0 Instance. MMC
structure was updated previously but the pin-mux structure was left out.

There was no error seen because the pin-mux value was higher(7) than
mode found(6). When both were OR'ed, correct value was taken and the
error was covered. This patch corrects the same.

This patch applies both for EVM, Beaglebone.
