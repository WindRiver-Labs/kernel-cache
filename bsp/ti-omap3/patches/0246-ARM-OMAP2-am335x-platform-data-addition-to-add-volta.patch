Subject: [PATCH 246/609] ARM: OMAP2+: am335x: platform data addition to add
 voltage ramp delay

Original commit: f561d12c4d83b44872e3e1fa964ca3b143022b61

  From git://arago-project.org/git/projects/linux-am33x.git
  And ti-sdk-am335x-evm-05.05.00.00-Linux-x86-Install image

This patch adds the minimum delay required to ramp the MPU voltage
from minimum OPP to maximum OPP, this is required only for BeagleBone.

MPU voltage transition from OPP50 to OPPTURBO took minimum of 70ms
to ramp completely when observed using an oscilloscope.

The reason for extended ramp time requirement on BeagleBone is not known.
This ramp time varies from board - board, if the board hangs with this
70msec delay also then try to increase this value.
