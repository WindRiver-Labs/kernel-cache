Subject: [PATCH 160/255] usb: dwc3: core: support optional PHYs

commit 122f06e60f90a43d9b2fb30662af688dfb759379 upstream

Since PHYs for dwc3 is optional (not all SoCs having PHYs for DWC3
should be programmed), do not return from probe if the USB PHY library
returns -ENODEV as that indicates the platform does not have a
programmable PHY.

While this can be considered as a temporary fix, a long term solution
would be to add 'nop' PHY for platforms that does not have programmable
PHY.
