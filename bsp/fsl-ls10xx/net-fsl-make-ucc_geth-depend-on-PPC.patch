Subject: [PATCH 068/129] net: fsl: make ucc_geth depend on PPC

The ucc_geth driver is only buildable on ppc platform. Previously it has
a dependency on QUICC_ENGINE. This was fine since QUICC_ENGINE was only
enabled on some ppc boards. But with the introduction of fsl ls boards,
the QUICC_ENGINE may be enabled on a arm platform and would cause build
error if this driver is enabled. So make it also depend on PPC.
