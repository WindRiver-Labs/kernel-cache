In commit 353d79304619 ("ARM: mx6: Fix suspend/resume with PCI"), it introduces
a workaround for ERR005723. But it is not stable, and need add some delay
between PCI devices resume. So I add mdelay(50) in imx6 pci driver's resume function
as a workaround. This resolution is harmless and only a tiny delay in resume.
