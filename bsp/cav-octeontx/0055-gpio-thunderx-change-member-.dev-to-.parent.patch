Subject: [PATCH 55/56] gpio: thunderx: change member .dev to .parent

The name .dev in a struct is normally reserved for a struct device
that is let us say a superclass to the thing described by the struct.
struct gpio_chip stands out by confusingly using a struct device *dev
to point to the parent device (such as a platform_device) that
represents the hardware. As we want to give gpio_chip:s real devices,
this is not working. We need to rename this member to parent.
