Subject: [PATCH 161/169] pwm: Conflict with legacy PWM API

Upstream ID: eac7a92fd0bc5b1edff0f9c7be5dce4f88491fb3

In order to avoid duplicate symbols with legacy PWM API implementations,
the new PWM framework needs to conflict with any of the existing legacy
implementations. This is done in two ways: for implementations provided
by drivers, a conflict is added to the driver to ensure it will have to
be ported to the PWM subsystem before it can coexist with other PWM
providers. For architecture-specific code, the conflict is added to the
PWM symbol to avoid confusion when a previously picked platform or
machine can no longer be selected because of the PWM subsystem being
included.
