From 50909a17bbbdcb86b945b66b6906f3701e0ce44e Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Thor Thayer <tthayer@altera.com>
Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2014 16:34:13 -0600
Subject: [PATCH 056/142] FogBugz #184650: Cleanup Altera license headers.

A few files have incorrect headers and some files do not have
any headers. The biggest issue is that some files say "GPLv2 or
later". The "or later" part is the problem.

V2:
Remove asterisks from date.
Correct lower portion of header
