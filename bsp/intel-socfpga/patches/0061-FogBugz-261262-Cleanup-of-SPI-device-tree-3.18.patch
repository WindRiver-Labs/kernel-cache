Subject: [PATCH 061/142] FogBugz #261262: Cleanup of SPI device tree (3.18)

When working on FogBugz# 261061, the spi-dev node was moved
into socfpga_cyclone5_socdk.dts as suggested by the upstream
community. These changes were made in 3.17 so to maintain
consistency, this commit brings the same changes to the 3.18
branch. Also noticed that a number of the spi1 fields were
wrong so those were fixed as well.
