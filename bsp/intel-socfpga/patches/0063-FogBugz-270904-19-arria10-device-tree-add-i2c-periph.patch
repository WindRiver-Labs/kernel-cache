From df9a77db6b0de045290b90529b8f60ed392a7f6c Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Alan Tull <atull@opensource.altera.com>
Date: Tue, 10 Mar 2015 11:37:38 -0500
Subject: [PATCH 063/142] FogBugz #270904-19: arria10: device tree: add i2c
 peripherals

Add the following i2c peripherals for arria10:
* Newhaven 16x2 lcd module
* max1619 temperature sensor
* ds1339 rtc
* ltc2977 monitor
* 24lc32 eeprom

Change the arria10 sdmmc and qspi dts's to have a common
socfpga_arria10_socdk.dtsi.  The only difference between the
socfpga_arria10_socdk_sdmmc.dts and socfpga_arria10_socdk_qspi.dts
is the sdmmc or qspi daughter card plugged into the socdk board.

Fix the copyright year and header for socfpga_arria10_socdk*.dts*

Enable ltc2977 and max1619 in defconfig.
