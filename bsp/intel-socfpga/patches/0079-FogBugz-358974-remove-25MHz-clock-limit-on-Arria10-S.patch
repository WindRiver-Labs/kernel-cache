Subject: [PATCH 079/142] FogBugz #358974: remove 25MHz clock limit on Arria10
 SD/MMC

The 25MHz clock limit was only applicable to Rev.A of the A10 devkits.
Since Rev.A devkits are no longer officially supported, we can remove
this limit, as all Rev. B+ devkits supports the full 50MHz clock speed.
