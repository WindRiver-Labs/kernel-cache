Subject: [PATCH 364/800] wlcore: always set MMC_PM_KEEP_POWER (workaround)

Due to some mmc layer issues, the system automatically
powers us up on resume, which later cause issues when
we try to restore_power again explicitly.

temporarily workaround it by always asking to keep power.
this is fine as driver controls the chip power anyway.
