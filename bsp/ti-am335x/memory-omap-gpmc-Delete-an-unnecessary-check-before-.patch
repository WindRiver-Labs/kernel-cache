Subject: [PATCH 872/895] memory: omap-gpmc: Delete an unnecessary check
 before the function call "gpiochip_free_own_desc"

The gpiochip_free_own_desc() function tests whether its argument is NULL
and then returns immediately. Thus the test around the call is not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
