Subject: [PATCH 292/800] cpufreq: voltdm: do a dummy opp setup as part of
 probe

As part of initial resource checks, we try and ensure that voltage
domain is ready with all required information. However to do that, we
also need to make sure that we have the OPP table initialized. Else, we
end up with:
  Adding alias for supply vdd,cpu0 -> vdd,4a0021c4.voltdm
  Adding alias for supply vbb,cpu0 -> vbb,4a0021c4.voltdm
  cpu cpu0: of_pm_voltdm_notifier_register: failed to get OPP, -19
  cpu cpu0: Failed to register cpu0 clock notifier: -19

To prevent this from happening, we do a dummy OPP initialization
and clean it up so that we can ensure all required voltage domain
information is also ready.
