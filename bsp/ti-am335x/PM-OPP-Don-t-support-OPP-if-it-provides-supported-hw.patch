Subject: [PATCH 843/895] PM / OPP: Don't support OPP if it provides
 supported-hw but platform does not

The OPP framework allows each OPP to set a opp-supported-hw property
which provides values that are matched against supported_hw values
provided by the platform to limit support for certain OPPs on specific
hardware. Currently, if the platform does not set supported_hw values,
all OPPs are interpreted as supported, even if they have provided their
own opp-supported-hw values.

If an OPP has provided opp-supported-hw, it is indicating that there is
some specific hardware configuration it is supported by. These constraints
should be honored, and if no supported_hw has been provided by the
platform, there is no way to determine if that OPP is actually supported,
so it should be marked as not supported.
