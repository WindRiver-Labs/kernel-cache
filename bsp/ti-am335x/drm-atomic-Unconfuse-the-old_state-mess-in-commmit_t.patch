Subject: [PATCH 320/895] drm/atomic: Unconfuse the old_state mess in
 commmit_tail

I totally butcherd the job on typing the kernel-doc for these, and no
one realized. Noticed by Russell. Maarten has a more complete approach
to this confusion, by making it more explicit what the new/old state
is, instead of this magic switching behaviour.

v2:
- Liviu pointed out that wait_for_fences is even more magic. Leave
that as @state, and document @pre_swap better.
- While at it, patch in header for the reference section.
- Fix spelling issues Russell noticed.

v3: Fix up the @pre_swap note (Liviu): Also s/synchronous/blocking/,
since async flip is something else than non-blocking.
