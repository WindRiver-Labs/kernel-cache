Subject: [PATCH 361/800] memory: gpmc: adopt pinctrl support

Update omap gpmc driver to set the state of the pins to:
- "sleep" on suspend
- "default" on resume

By optionally putting the pins into sleep state in the suspend callback
we can accomplish two things.
- minimize current leakage from pins and thus save power,
- prevent the IP from driving pins output in an uncontrolled manner,
which may happen if the power domain drops the domain regulator.
