Subject: [PATCH 086/188] ASoC: davinci: Kconfig: Support for AM43XX based
 boards

This commit comes from branch ti-linux-3.12.y:

git://git.ti.com/ti-linux-kernel/ti-linux-kernel.git

The generic davinci-evm board can support AM43XX based boards with
tlv320aic3106 codec since the McASP and DMA engine within AM33XX and AM43XX
is the same.
