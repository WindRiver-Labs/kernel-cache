Subject: [PATCH 862/895] cpufreq: dt: Update kconfig description

The cpufreq DT driver also supports systems that have multiple
clock/voltage domains for CPUs, i.e. multiple policy systems.

The description of the Kconfig entry was never updated after the driver
was modified to support such systems, fix it.
