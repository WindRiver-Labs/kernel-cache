Subject: [PATCH 854/895] PM / OPP: ti-opp-supply: Check for invalid ranges
 before attempt

Check the voltage ranges that are valid before attempting to scale
voltage. Typically this occurs with samples that may have been old and
no longer follow the updated specification OR when devicetree data
itself is wrong or corrupted.
