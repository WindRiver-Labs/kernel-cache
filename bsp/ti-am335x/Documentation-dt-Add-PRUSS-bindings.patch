Subject: [PATCH 577/895] Documentation: dt: Add PRUSS bindings

This patch adds the bindings for the Programmable Real-Time Unit
and Industrial Communication Subsystem (PRU-ICSS) present on various
TI SoCs (limited to OMAP architecture based SoCs for now). Details
have been added to include bindings for various core sub-modules
like the PRU Cores, the PRUSS Interrupt Controller, and other
sub-modules used for Industrial Communication purposes, covering
the MDIO, MII_RT and the IEP sub-modules. The binding uses all
standard DT properties without introducing any specific properties.

The binding status is also marked as unstable as the binding does
not cover all the sub-modules that are present within the PRU-ICSS,
and is also subject to improvements and changes upstream.

+PRU-ICSS on TI SoCs
+===================
+
+Binding status: Unstable - Subject to changes
+
+The Programmable Real-Time Unit and Industrial Communication Subsystem
+(PRU-ICSS) is present on various TI SoCs such as AM335x or AM437x or a
+Keystone 66AK2G. A PRUSS consists of dual 32-bit RISC cores (Programmable
+Real-Time Units, or PRUs), shared RAM, data and instruction RAMs, some
+internal peripheral modules to facilitate industrial communication, and
+an interrupt controller. The programmable nature of the PRUs provide
+flexibility to implement custom peripheral interfaces, fast real-time
+responses, or specialized data handling. The common peripheral modules
+include the following,
+  - an Ethernet MII_RT module with two MII ports
+  - an MDIO port to control external Ethernet PHYs
+  - an Industrial Ethernet Peripheral (IEP) to manage/generate Industrial
+    Ethernet functions
+  - an Enhanced Capture Module (eCAP)
+  - an Industrial Ethernet Timer with 7/9 capture and 16 compare events
+  - a 16550-compatible UART to support PROFIBUS
+
+A PRU-ICSS subsystem can have up to three shared data memories. A PRU core
+acts on a primary Data RAM (there are usually 2 Data RAMs) at its address
+0x0, but also has access to a secondary Data RAM (primary to the other PRU
+core) at its address 0x2000. A shared Data RAM, if present, can be accessed
+by both the PRU cores. The Interrupt Controller (INTC) and a CFG module are
+common to both the PRU cores. Each PRU core also has a private instruction RAM,
+and specific register spaces for Control and Debug functionalities.
+
+Various sub-modules within a PRU-ICSS subsystem are represented as individual
+nodes and are defined using a parent-child hierarchy depending on their
+integration within the IP and the SoC. These nodes are described in the
+following sections.
+
+
+PRU-ICSS SoC Bus Parent Node
+=============================
+This node represents the integration of the PRU-ICSS IP into a SoC, and is
+required for all SoCs. The PRU-ICSS parent nodes need to be defined as child
+nodes of this node.
+
+Required Properties:
+--------------------
+- compatible     : should be one of,
+                       "ti,am3356-pruss-soc-bus" for AM335x family of SoCs
+                       "ti,am4376-pruss-soc-bus" for AM437x family of SoCs
+                       "ti,am5728-pruss-soc-bus" for AM57xx family of SoCs
+- ti,hwmods      : name of the hwmod associated with the PRUSS instance
+- reg            : base address and size of the PRUSS CFG sub-module containing
+                   the SoC interconnect configuration register
+- #address-cells : should be 1
+- #size-cells    : should be 1
+- ranges         : no specific range translations required, child nodes have the
+                   same address view as the parent, so should be mentioned without
+                   any value for the property
+
+
+PRU-ICSS Parent Node
+=====================
+Each PRU-ICSS subsystem instance is represented as a child node of
+the PRUSS SoC bus node, with the individual PRU processor cores, an
+INTC node and an MDIO node represented as child nodes within this
+parent PRUSS node.
+
+Required Properties:
+--------------------
+- compatible     : should be one of,
+                       "ti,am3356-pruss" for AM335x family of SoCs
+                       "ti,am4376-pruss" for AM437x family of SoCs
+                       "ti,am5728-pruss" for AM57xx family of SoCs
+- reg            : base address and size for each of the sub-modules as
+                   mentioned in reg-names, and in the same order as the
+                   reg-names
+- reg-names      : should contain a string from among the following names,
+                   each representing a specific sub-module. A PRU-ICSS may
+                   not have all of the Data RAMs. The binding is agnostic
+                   of the order of these reg-names
+                       "dram0" for Data RAM0,
+                       "dram1" for Data RAM1,
+                       "shrdram2" for Shared Data RAM,
+                       "cfg" for CFG sub-module,
+                       "iep" for IEP sub-module,
+                       "mii_rt" for MII-RT sub-module,
+- #address-cells : should be 1
+- #size-cells    : should be 1
+- ranges         : no specific range translations required, child nodes have the
+                   same address view as the parent, so should be mentioned without
+                   any value for the property
+
+
+PRUSS INTC Child Node
+======================
+Each PRUSS has a single interrupt controller instance that is common to both
+the PRU cores. Each interrupt controller can detect 64 input events which are
+then mapped to 10 possible output interrupts through two levels of mapping. The
+input events can be triggered by either the PRUs and/or various other PRUSS
+internal and external peripherals.  The first 2 output interrupts are fed
+exclusively to the internal PRU cores, with the remaining 8 connected to
+external interrupt controllers including the MPU.
+
+Required Properties:
+--------------------
+- compatible           : should be one of,
+                             "ti,am3356-pruss-intc" for AM335x family of SoCs
+                             "ti,am4376-pruss-intc" for AM437x family of SoCs
+                             "ti,am5728-pruss-intc" for AM57xx family of SoCs
+- reg                  : base address and size for the PRUSS INTC sub-module
+- reg-names            : should contain the string "intc"
+- interrupts           : all the interrupts generated towards the main host
+                         processor in the SoC. The format depends on the
+                         interrupt specifier for the particular SoC's MPU
+                         parent interrupt controller
+- interrupt-names      : should use one of the following names for each
+                         interrupt, the name should match the corresponding
+                         host interrupt number,
+                             "host2", "host3", "host4", "host5", "host6",
+                             "host7", "host8" or "host9"
+                         NOTE: AM437x SoCs do not have "host7" interrupt
+                               connected to MPU
+- interrupt-controller : mark this node as an interrupt controller
+- #interrupt-cells     : should be 1. Client users shall use the PRU System
+                         event number (the interrupt source that the client
+                         is interested in) as the value of the interrupts
+                         property in their node
+
+
+PRU Child Node
+===============
+Each PRUSS has dual PRU cores, each represented by a PRU child node. Each node
+can optionally be rendered inactive by using the standard DT string property,
+"status".
+
+Required Properties:
+--------------------
+- compatible     : should be
+                       "ti,am3356-pru" for AM335x family of SoCs
+                       "ti,am4376-pru" for AM437x family of SoCs
+                       "ti,am5728-pru" for AM57xx family of SoCs
+- reg            : base address and size for each of the 3 sub-module address
+                   spaces as mentioned in reg-names, and in the same order as
+                   the reg-names
+- reg-names      : should contain each of the following 3 names, with the "iram"
+                   entry being the first one
+                       "iram" for Instruction RAM,
+                       "control" for the CTRL sub-module registers,
+                       "debug" for the Debug sub-module registers,
+
+Optional Properties:
+--------------------
+The virtio based communication between the MPU and a PRU core _requires_
+either the 'mboxes' property, or the set of 'interrupt-parent', 'interrupts'
+and 'interrupt-names' properties to be defined.
+
+- mboxes           : OMAP Mailbox specifier denoting the sub-mailbox, if using
+                     a mailbox for IPC signalling between host and a PRU core.
+                     The specifier format is as per the bindings,
+                         Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/omap-mailbox.txt
+                     This property should match with the sub-mailbox node used
+                     in the corresponding firmware image.
+- interrupt-parent : phandle to the PRUSS INTC node. Should be defined if
+                     interrupts property is to be used.
+- interrupts       : array of interrupt specifiers if using PRU system events
+                     for IPC signalling between host and a PRU core. This
+                     property should match with the PRU system event used in
+                     the corresponding firmware image.
+- interrupt-names  : should use one of the following names for each interrupt,
+                     the name should match the corresponding PRU system event
+                     number,
+                         "vring" - for PRU to HOST virtqueue signalling
+                         "kick"  - for HOST to PRU virtqueue signalling
+
+
+MDIO Child Node
+================
+Each PRUSS has an MDIO module that can be used to control external PHYs. The
+MDIO module used within the PRU-ICSS is an instance of the MDIO Controller
+used in TI Davinci SoCs. Please refer to the corresponding binding document,
+Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/davinci-mdio.txt for details.
