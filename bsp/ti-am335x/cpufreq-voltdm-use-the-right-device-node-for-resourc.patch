Subject: [PATCH 291/800] cpufreq: voltdm: use the right device node for
 resource readiness check

We have cpufreq-voltdm as a dummy device with an empty device node
pointer which contains no useful information. This dummy device is used
to initialize the probe sequence inside cpufreq-voltdm. cpufreq-voltdm
then registers the cpufreq driver on the cpu nodes as needed once the
required resources are ready.

However, as part of the voltage domain readiness check, we unfortunately
try to parse the wrong node pointer (the dummy node pointer containing
no information), instead of the cpu node pointer which actually has the
required regulator and OPP information.

By not using the correct node pointer, we pass through the voltage
domain verification even though we do not have regulators available,
and the registration logic later on fails.

Fix this at the source by ensuring we pass the correct node pointer for
verification.
