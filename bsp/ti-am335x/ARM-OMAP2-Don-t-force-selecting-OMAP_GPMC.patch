Subject: [PATCH 696/895] ARM: OMAP2+: Don't force selecting OMAP_GPMC

OMAP_GPMC requires CONFIG_MEMORY to be enabled. However, by forcing
OMAP_GPMC to be selected dependencies are ignored. This is a problem
since it means OMAP_GPMC is always enabled even when it shouldn't be.

By avoiding this force selection it insures that OMAP_GPMC is only
enabled when its dependencies are met.
