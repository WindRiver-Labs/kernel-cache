Subject: [PATCH 536/895] remoteproc: Remove "experimental" warning

Warning users that remoteproc and it's binary format are under
development doesn't serve much of a purpose. Different drivers support
different image formats and the resource table has a version field that
would need to be bumped when incompatible changes are introduced.

So lets drop this warning to clean up the kernel log.
