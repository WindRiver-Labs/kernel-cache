Subject: [PATCH 511/895] rpmsg: Move rpmsg_device API to new file

Extract the now indirect rpmsg_create_ept() interface to a separate
file and start building up a rpmsg core.

Signed-off-by: Bjorn Andersson <bjorn.andersson@linaro.org>
(cherry picked from commit 026dad47a814cd32aad6174a8f1218b020a277b1)
