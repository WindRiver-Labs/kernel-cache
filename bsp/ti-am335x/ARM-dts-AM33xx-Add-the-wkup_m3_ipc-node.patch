Subject: [PATCH 193/800] ARM: dts: AM33xx: Add the wkup_m3_ipc node

commit 99937129075a907a5e4ba52cf0ebdbde9ff6be15 upstream

Add the Wakeup M3 IPC node for the wkup_m3_ipc driver on AM33xx SoCs.
This node uses the IPC registers, part of the Control Module, and is
therefore added as a child of the scm node.
