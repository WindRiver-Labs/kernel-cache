Subject: [PATCH 592/895] remoteproc/omap: check for all timer ops for
 watchdog timers

The timers and watchdog timers are both optional for OMAP remoteproc
devices. The timers are rarely not defined though especially given
that they are a absolute must for any active power management. But,
there can potentially be a configuration where timers are not defined
and only watchdog timers are defined. All of these also require all
the timer ops to be defined, so ensure that all timer ops are checked
even for the watchdog timers, and be agnostic of the presence of
regular timers.

Fixes: 398afae34f11 ("remoteproc/omap: add watchdog functionality for remote processors")
