Subject: [PATCH 182/800] ARM: dts: AM33xx: Update and move wkup_m3 node to l4
 node

commit d129be27b8cffcec706b0ccf143c93fba8cc5726 upstream

The WakeupM3 remote processor device node has been moved to
be a child node of the newly created l4_wkup node, to reflect
its presence properly within the SoC. The node was added
previously before any driver support, it is now updated as
per the wkup_m3_rproc bindings added alongside the driver
support.
