Subject: [PATCH 03/92] sdhci-of: Set the timeout to the max value

Extracted from 913x_WUSDK_REL_0.4.tar.gz vendor drop.

When access the card, the following error is reported:

   mmc0: Got data interrupt 0x00000020 even though no data operation was in progress.
   mmc0: Got data interrupt 0x00000020 even though no data operation was in progress.

so we skip the calculation of timeout and use the max value.
