Subject: [PATCH 06/10] DPAA/fman: remove setting tbiaddr for fman-mdio

We can remove setting tbiaddr section completely. For FMAN Ethernet the TBI phy
address register doesn't exit in MII controller registers, and the fsl_pq_mdio
driver doesn't set the TBI phy address at all. So the probing of TBI phy address
for fman-mdio seems useless here. In fact the TBI phy address is set in the
dtsec mac driver.
