Subject: [PATCH] spi: zynq-qspi: Wait for FIFO to be empty when switching TXD
 registers

This patch comes from:
      https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx.git

When switching from TXD0 to TXD1/2/3, software has to wait for FIFO to be
empty before writing to TXD1/2/3 as per the documentation.

Although previous discussions and tests revealed that this waiting
is required only for TXD1/2/3 to TXD0 switches and not vice-verse,
design team conveyed that TXD0 to TXD1/2/3 switching can behave unpredictably
if wait is not used. Hence this change is made to comply.
