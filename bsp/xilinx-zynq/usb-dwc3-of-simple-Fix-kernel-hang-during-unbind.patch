Subject: [PATCH 755/793] usb: dwc3: of-simple: Fix kernel hang during unbind
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In dwc3_of_simple_remove() we call of_platform_depopulate() after
disabling the clocks. Since of_platform_depopulate() calls xhci_stop()
which internally stop the controller by programming the USB registers.
Since we already disabled the USB clock, kernel hangs when try to unbind.

This patch corrects the above said issue by calling of_platform_depopulate
before clock disabling.
