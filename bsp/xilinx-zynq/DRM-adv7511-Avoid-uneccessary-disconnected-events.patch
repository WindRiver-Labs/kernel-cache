Subject: [PATCH 245/509] DRM: adv7511: Avoid uneccessary disconnected events

https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/linux.git xcomm_zynq
commit 586f4ff1df6998ab4306f40230da90e1d95d2cc8

Only insert a delayed disconnected event when we transition from connected to
connect. If we transition from disconnected to connected there is no need for
this since the system will already assume that the monitor was disconnected.
