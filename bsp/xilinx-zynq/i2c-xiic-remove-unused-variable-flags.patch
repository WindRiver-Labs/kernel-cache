Subject: [PATCH] i2c: xiic: remove unused variable flags

fixed a build warning as follow:
    drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-xiic.c:364:16: warning:
    unused variable
      'flags' [-Wunused-variable]
      unsigned long flags;

This variable is introduced by commit (i2c: xiic: move the xiic_process...)
a925aa64ca71c9ab66ad60dfc23e35279997b677
In fact it may be a careless mistake, the variable doesn't exist
in the origin upstream patch.
