Subject: [PATCH 413/456] adv7604: Update recommended writes for the adv7611

Update the recommended writes to those mentioned in the Rev 1.5 version of the
ADV7611 Register Settings Recommendations document released by Analog Devices.
The document does not mention why the recommended settings have been updated,
but presumably those are more fine tuned settings that can enhance performance
in some cases.

(cherry picked from commit a6329ceaf60160418fc80dbdc3f9b89dfe869470)
