Subject: [PATCH 759/793] mmc: arasan: Add ADMA broken quirk based on DT
 parameter

This patch adds 'SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_ADMA' quirk to the
sdhci arasan controller based on the DT property.
With 4.6 kernel, ADMA2 is broken. So added this quirk as
a workaround and can be reverted once kernel is upgraded
or actual solution is found.
Issue with ADMA2 can be seen with the following three steps
done in regression.
1. mount SD card.
2. Read and write some random data ~1MB.
3. reboot the board.
Issue is visible after running 15 to 20mins with 4.6 kernel
and there might be a chance that issue might occur very
frequently depending on the application.
So, using the above workaround to force the controller to
use SDMA.
The performance difference between SDMA and ADMA2 is around
10-15%.
ADMA2 can be used by removing the 'broken-adma2' property
from devicetree.
