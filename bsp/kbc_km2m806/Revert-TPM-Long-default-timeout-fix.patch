Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Revert "TPM: Long default timeout fix"

commit: 8d1dc20e8d689c7e6a0a4d2c94e36a99d5793ecb upstream

This reverts commit c4ff4b829ef9e6353c0b133b7adb564a68054979.

Ted Ts'o reports:

 "TPM is working for me so I can log into employer's network in 2.6.37.
  It broke when I tried 2.6.38-rc6, with the following relevant lines
  from my dmesg:

  [   11.081627] tpm_tis 00:0b: 1.2 TPM (device-id 0x0, rev-id 78)
  [   25.734114] tpm_tis 00:0b: Operation Timed out
  [   78.040949] tpm_tis 00:0b: Operation Timed out

  This caused me to get suspicious, especially since the _other_ TPM
  commit in 2.6.38 had already been reverted, so I tried reverting
  commit c4ff4b829e: "TPM: Long default timeout fix".  With this commit
  reverted, my TPM on my Lenovo T410 is once again working."
