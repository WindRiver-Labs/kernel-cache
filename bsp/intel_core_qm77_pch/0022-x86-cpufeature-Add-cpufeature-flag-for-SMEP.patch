Subject: [PATCH 22/26] x86, cpufeature: Add cpufeature flag for SMEP

Upstream ID: d0281a25

Add support for newly documented SMEP (Supervisor Mode Execution Protection) CPU
feature flag.

SMEP prevents the CPU in kernel-mode to jump to an executable page
that has the user flag set in the PTE.  This prevents the kernel from
executing user-space code accidentally or maliciously, so it for
example prevents kernel exploits from jumping to specially prepared
user-mode shell code.

[ hpa: added better description by Ingo Molnar ]
