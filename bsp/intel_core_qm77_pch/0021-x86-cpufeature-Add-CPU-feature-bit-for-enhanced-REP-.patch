Subject: [PATCH 21/26] x86, cpufeature: Add CPU feature bit for enhanced REP MOVSB/STOSB

Upstream ID: 724a92ee

Intel processors are adding enhancements to REP MOVSB/STOSB and the use of
REP MOVSB/STOSB for optimal memcpy/memset or similar functions is recommended.
Enhancement availability is indicated by CPUID.7.0.EBX[9] (Enhanced REP MOVSB/
STOSB).
