Subject: [PATCH 09/26] x86, cpufeature: Update CPU feature RDRND to RDRAND

Upstream ID: 7ccafc5f

The Intel manual changed the name of the CPUID bit to match the
instruction name. We should follow suit for sanity's sake. (See Intel SDM
Volume 2, Table 3-20 "Feature Information Returned in the ECX Register".)

[ hpa: we can only do this at this time because there are currently no CPUs
  with this feature on the market, hence this is pre-hardware enabling.
  However, Cc:'ing stable so that stable can present a consistent ABI. ]
