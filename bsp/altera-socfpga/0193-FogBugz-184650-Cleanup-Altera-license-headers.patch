From 8e0358653b5928095f33caef8003218073d96326 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Thor Thayer <tthayer@altera.com>
Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2014 16:34:13 -0600
Subject: [PATCH 193/248] FogBugz #184650: Cleanup Altera license headers.

A few files have incorrect headers and some files do not have
any headers. The biggest issue is that some files say "GPLv2 or
later". The "or later" part is the problem.

V2:
Remove asterisks from date.
Correct lower portion of header

[Original patch taken from
git://git.rocketboards.org/linux-socfpga.git socfpga-3.14]
