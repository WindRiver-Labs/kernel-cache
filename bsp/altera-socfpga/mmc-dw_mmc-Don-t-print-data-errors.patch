Subject: [PATCH] mmc: dw_mmc: Don't print data errors

commit e6cc0123d91e52a454d9e958b9124ca8a61fd82c upstream

Data errors are completely expected during tuning.  Printing them out
is confusing people looking at the kernel logs.  They see things like:

 [    3.613296] dwmmc_exynos 12200000.dwmmc0: data error, status 0x00000088

...and they think something is wrong with their hardware.

Remove the printouts.  We'll leave it up to a higher level to report
about errors.
