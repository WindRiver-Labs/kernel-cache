From 5625b97546eca9a1d12745d103c066c04ee8b4c9 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Thor Thayer <tthayer@altera.com>
Date: Tue, 18 Feb 2014 16:34:13 -0600
Subject: [PATCH 086/172] FogBugz #184650: Cleanup Altera license headers.

A few files have incorrect headers and some files do not have
any headers. The biggest issue is that some files say "GPLv2 or
later". The "or later" part is the problem.

V2:
Remove asterisks from date.
Correct lower portion of header
