Subject: [PATCH 064/172] mailbox: Introduce a new common API

Introduce common framework for client/protocol drivers and
controller drivers of Inter-Processor-Communication (IPC).

Client driver developers should have a look at
 include/linux/mailbox_client.h to understand the part of
the API exposed to client drivers.
Similarly controller driver developers should have a look
at include/linux/mailbox_controller.h
