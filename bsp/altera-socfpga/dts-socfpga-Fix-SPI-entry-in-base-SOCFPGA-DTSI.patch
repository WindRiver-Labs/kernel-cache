Subject: [PATCH 08/13] dts/socfpga: Fix SPI entry in base SOCFPGA DTSI

commit ba0f5d61dae00d50c85ad69a72fe40b76853a239
git://git.rocketboards.org/linux-socfpga.git socfpga-3.10-ltsi
There were 2 issues with the SPI entry in the DTSI.
- Fixed the SPI IRQ value for SPI1 (now is 155)
- CAN bus uses the same pins as SPI1, set SPI1 status="disabled"

v2:
Fix header summary to better reflect these changes.
