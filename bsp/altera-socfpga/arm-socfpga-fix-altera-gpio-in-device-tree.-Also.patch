Subject: [PATCH 190/254] arm: socfpga: fix altera gpio in device tree. Also

Upstream: git://git.rocketboards.org/linux-socfpga.git
 fix docs.

dts fixes for altera fpga so that it won't fail to probe.
also fix documentation, adding some things that were left out
(regs, interrupts) and clean up formatting for readability.

 Required properties:
 - compatible:
   - "altr,pio-1.0"
+- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
 - #gpio-cells : Should be two.
   - first cell is the pin number
   - second cell is used to specify optional parameters (unused)
 - gpio-controller : Marks the device node as a GPIO controller.
 - #interrupt-cells : Should be 1.
+- interrupts: Specify the interrupt.
 - interrupt-controller: Mark the device node as an interrupt controller
   The first cell is the GPIO number.
