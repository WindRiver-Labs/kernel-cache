Subject: [PATCH 116/248] FogBugz #139359: Device tree changes for PL330 DMA
 driver to support socfpga CycloneV

Added multiple interrupts to device tree.
Added copy-align to device tree.
Added clocks and clock-names to device tree.
Updated documentation for pl330 device tree bindings.

[Original patch taken from
git://git.rocketboards.org/linux-socfpga.git socfpga-3.14]

V2:

Remove documentation for clocks and clock-names from arm-pl330.txt, as
they are documented in primecell.txt.
