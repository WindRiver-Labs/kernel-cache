Subject: [PATCH 046/142] pwm: Export of_pwm_xlate_with_flags()

commit 417328c3f77187f5d8cc433627c25eb1063c1507 upstream

Drivers may want to use this function if they support any of the flags
that can be passed via a third cell in the DT specifier. Since those
drivers may be built as modules the symbol needs to be exported to make
sure that it can be accessed.
