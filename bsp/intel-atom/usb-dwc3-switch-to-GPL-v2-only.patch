Subject: [PATCH 125/142] usb: dwc3: switch to GPL v2 only

commit 5945f789c864d8676b297880cc6961fea4511a7a upstream

This is a Linux-only driver which makes use
of GPL-only symbols. It makes no sense to
maintain Dual BSD/GPL licensing for this driver.

Considering that the amount of work to use this
driver in any different operating system would likely
be as large as developing the driver from scratch and
considering that we depend on GPL-only symbols, we
will switch over to a GPL v2-only license.
