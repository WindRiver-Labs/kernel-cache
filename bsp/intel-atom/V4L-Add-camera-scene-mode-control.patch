Subject: [PATCH 026/252] V4L: Add camera scene mode control

commit 0bf6b7dc5fd1e60e93657d4fe4b3d788216b9d5e upstream

Add control for the scene mode feature available in image sensor
with more advanced ISP firmware. The V4L2_CID_SCENE_MODE menu
control allows to select a set of parameters or a specific image
processing and capture control algorithm optimized for common
image capture conditions.

+		</row>
+		<row>
+		  <entry><constant>V4L2_SCENE_MODE_BEACH_SNOW</constant>&nbsp;</entry>
+		  <entry>Beach and snow. This mode compensates for all-white or
+bright scenes, which tend to look gray and low contrast, when camera's automatic
+exposure is based on an average scene brightness. To compensate, this mode
+automatically slightly overexposes the frames. The white balance may also be
+adjusted to compensate for the fact that reflected snow looks bluish rather
+than white.</entry>
+		</row>
+		<row>
+		  <entry><constant>V4L2_SCENE_MODE_CANDLELIGHT</constant>&nbsp;</entry>
+		  <entry>Candle light. The camera generally raises the ISO
+sensitivity and lowers the shutter speed. This mode compensates for relatively
+close subject in the scene. The flash is disabled in order to preserve the
+ambiance of the light.</entry>
+		</row>
+		<row>
+		  <entry><constant>V4L2_SCENE_MODE_DAWN_DUSK</constant>&nbsp;</entry>
+		  <entry>Dawn and dusk. Preserves the colors seen in low
+natural light before dusk and after down. The camera may turn off the flash,
+and automatically focus at infinity. It will usually boost saturation and
+lower the shutter speed.</entry>
+		</row>
+		<row>
+		  <entry><constant>V4L2_SCENE_MODE_FALL_COLORS</constant>&nbsp;</entry>
+		  <entry>Fall colors. Increases saturation and adjusts white

+		<row>
+		  <entry><constant>V4L2_SCENE_MODE_FIREWORKS</constant>&nbsp;</entry>

+		</row>
+		<row>
+		  <entry><constant>V4L2_SCENE_MODE_LANDSCAPE</constant>&nbsp;</entry>
+		  <entry>Landscape. The camera may choose a small aperture to
+provide deep depth of field and long exposure duration to help capture detail
+in dim light conditions. The focus is fixed at infinity. Suitable for distant
+and wide scenery.</entry>
+		</row>
+		<row>
+		  <entry><constant>V4L2_SCENE_MODE_NIGHT</constant>&nbsp;</entry>
+		  <entry>Night, also known as Night Landscape. Designed for low
+light conditions, it preserves detail in the dark areas without blowing out bright
+objects. The camera generally sets itself to a medium-to-high ISO sensitivity,
+with a relatively long exposure time, and turns flash off. As such, there will be
+increased image noise and the possibility of blurred image.</entry>
+		</row>
+		<row>
+		  <entry><constant>V4L2_SCENE_MODE_PARTY_INDOOR</constant>&nbsp;</entry>
+		  <entry>Party and indoor. Designed to capture indoor scenes
+that are lit by indoor background lighting as well as the flash. The camera
+usually increases ISO sensitivity, and adjusts exposure for the low light
+conditions.</entry>
+		</row>
+		<row>
+		  <entry><constant>V4L2_SCENE_MODE_PORTRAIT</constant>&nbsp;</entry>
+		  <entry>Portrait. The camera adjusts the aperture so that the
+depth of field is reduced, which helps to isolate the subject against a smooth
+background. Most cameras recognize the presence of faces in the scene and focus
+on them. The color hue is adjusted to enhance skin tones. The intensity of the
+flash is often reduced.</entry>
+		</row>
+		<row>
+		  <entry><constant>V4L2_SCENE_MODE_SPORTS</constant>&nbsp;</entry>
+		  <entry>Sports. Significantly increases ISO and uses a fast
+shutter speed to freeze motion of rapidly-moving subjects. Increased image
+noise may be seen in this mode.</entry>
+		</row>
+		<row>
+		  <entry><constant>V4L2_SCENE_MODE_SUNSET</constant>&nbsp;</entry>
+		  <entry>Sunset. Preserves deep hues seen in sunsets and
+sunrises. It bumps up the saturation.</entry>

+		<row>
+		  <entry><constant>V4L2_SCENE_MODE_TEXT</constant>&nbsp;</entry>
+		  <entry>Text. It applies extra contrast and sharpness, it is
+typically a black-and-white mode optimized for readability. Automatic focus
