Subject: [PATCH 088/252] pvrusb2: Stop statically initializing reserved
 struct fields to zero

commit 5f1a12f5d03ecd920e09c08e1b9fc1312a1d6da4 upstream

In any statically initialized data structure, the compiler is going to
zero any part which is not already explicitly initialized.  While we
can take that knowledge overboard and simply avoid initializing
anything that needs to be zero, it's at least a good idea not to
bother zeroing parts that we don't otherwise care about - like
"reserved" fields which may change in the future.  Avoiding
initialization of those fields now also avoids possible conflict down
the road.
