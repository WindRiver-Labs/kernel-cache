Subject: [PATCH 065/142] Revert "a workaround for 8250 pci driver bug"

This reverts commit "a workaround for 8250 pci driver bug". This bug was introduced
by the Yocto Project BayTrail BSP's HSUART patch. This patch will be replaced by
the mainline commits, so the fix based on this patch should also be reverted.
