Subject: [PATCH 0890/1072] mtd: nand: stop exporting nand_default_bbt

commit 552fb55d6e0a83a751385cebc214c090626765fc upstream

I removed the last non-nand_base users of this, and we shouldn't have
any more modules that need to access it. It's only non-static to share
between nand_base and nand_bbt.
