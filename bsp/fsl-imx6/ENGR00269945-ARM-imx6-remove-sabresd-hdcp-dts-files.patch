Subject: [PATCH 0162/1072] ENGR00269945: ARM: imx6: remove sabresd hdcp dts
 files

git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_3.10.17_1.0.0_beta
commit c282dc8ccd6ca6e41ab7a6c95107753b61db9eb5

Since U-Boot provide good support for modify device tree blob (DTB) at
run-time with 'fdt' command, we do not have to maintain extra DTS files
just for pin conflict case.
