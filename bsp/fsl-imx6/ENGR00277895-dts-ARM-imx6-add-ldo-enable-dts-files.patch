Subject: [PATCH 0196/1072] ENGR00277895: dts: ARM: imx6: add ldo-enable dts
 files

git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_3.10.17_1.0.0_beta
commit 5a87f28b9d9d41c4a6f612facbef25f79f768073

  Currently, we use different dts files to support ldo-bypass or ldo-enable, then
we need add both dts files for the boards which can support ldo-bypass mode(all
boards support ldo-enable at least). So for below boards we need add ldo-enable
dts file so that we can use this to easily support ldo-enable mode:
  1)mx6q-sabresd board:  ldo-bypass dts->mx6q-sabresd.dtb,
                         ldo-enable dts->mx6q-sabresd-ldo.dtb
  2)mx6q-sabresd board:  ldo-bypass dts->mx6dl-sabresd.dtb,
	                 ldo-enable dts->mx6dl-sabresd-ldo.dtb
  3)mx6sl-evk board:     ldo-bypass dts->mx6sl-evk.dtb,
	                 ldo-enable dts->mx6sl-evk-ldo.dtb
