Subject: [PATCH 0188/1072] ENGR00276199 ARM: imx: Update VDDARM_CAP's voltag
 for cpufreq table

git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_3.10.17_1.0.0_beta
commit c5203a58edfd8e4637256fe74dd503905d5b43a1

According to datasheet, VDD_CACHE_CAP must not exceed VDDARM_CAP
by more than 200mV, as all of our i.MX6Q boards' VDD_CACHE_CAP
are connected to VDDSOC_CAP, so we need to follow this rule by
increasing VDDARM_CAP's voltage when necessary.
