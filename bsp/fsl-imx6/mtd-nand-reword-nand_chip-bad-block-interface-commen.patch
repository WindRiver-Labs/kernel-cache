Subject: [PATCH 0999/1072] mtd: nand: reword nand_chip bad block interface
 comments

commit ce157510eb886feb996a7a13354973bdf4aae1a1 upstream

This remedies a few problems:

(1) The use of "the" vs. "a" is a little confusing, IMO.

(2) nand_chip.block_bad is used exclusively for checking the OOB bad
    block markers of a NAND. Any BBT functionality is handled in
    nand_bbt.c, so this description should differentiate itself from
    nand_bbt.c.
