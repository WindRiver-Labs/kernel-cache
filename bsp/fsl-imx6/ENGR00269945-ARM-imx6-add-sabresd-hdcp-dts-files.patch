Subject: [PATCH 0269/1072] ENGR00269945: ARM: imx6: add sabresd hdcp dts
 files

git://git.freescale.com/imx/linux-2.6-imx.git imx_3.10.17_1.0.0_beta
commit 605b4cf50a7be1d5e3de307012c06b4a03150927

It's basically a revert of commit fc52e42 (ENGR00269945: ARM: imx6:
remove sabresd hdcp dts files).

As we agree that maintaining multiple dts files for internal tree should
not be a problem, let's add the hdcp dts files back as the solution to
hdcp pin conflict.
