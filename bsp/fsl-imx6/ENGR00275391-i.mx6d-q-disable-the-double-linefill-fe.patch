Subject: [PATCH 1/2] ENGR00275391 i.mx6d/q: disable the double linefill
 feature of PL310

commit 30a422671220712c57bd6c930cb29d0e96d544ec upstream

The L2 cache controller(PL310) version on the i.MX6D/Q is r3p1-50rel0
The L2 cache controller(PL310) version on the i.MX6DL/SOLO/SL is r3p2
But according to ARM PL310 errata: 752271
ID: 752271: Double linefill feature can cause data corruption
Fault Status: Present in: r3p0, r3p1, r3p1-50rel0. Fixed in r3p2
Workaround: The only workaround to this erratum is to disable the
double linefill feature. This is the default behavior.

[in the commit:c483abdca0011c1342bad42f16925dd5a2c7c091]
ENGR00271977-1 imx6_defconfig: enable PL310_ERRATA_769419

There is one error in the commit log, the correct PL310 version in
i.MX6DL/SOLO should be r3p2, not r3p1-50rel0.

so, PL310_ERRATA_769419, will not apply to i.MX6DL/SOLO. But since we build
one image to support both i.MX6Q and i.MX6DL/SOLO, the ideal solution is to
manage this errata in dynamic way. Someone did post the patches here:
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2013-January/145593.html

As the discussion on the above link, Russell King, the ARM arch maintainer said:

"As I already said, there is _no_ point making the barrier conditional;
it's probably more expensive to make it conditional than just to execute
it every time.  But we still might as well optimize it away if we are
running _only_ on platforms which _do_ _not_ have that errata."

So, we will turn on the PL310_ERRATA_769419 on both i.MX6D/Q and i.MX6DL/SOLO.
