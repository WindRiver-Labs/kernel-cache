Subject: [PATCH 140/347] mmc: omap_hsmmc: restore adma settings after context
 loss

This patch comes from:
  git://git.ti.com/processor-sdk/processor-sdk-linux.git

Restore settings needed for ADMA after HSMMC loses
context on runtime suspend. Without this, platforms
using ADMA will hang after runtime resume on MMC
access after context has been lost.

This was discovered on K2G EVM, but should affect other
platforms too where ADMA is used and HSMMC context could
be lost on runtime suspend.
