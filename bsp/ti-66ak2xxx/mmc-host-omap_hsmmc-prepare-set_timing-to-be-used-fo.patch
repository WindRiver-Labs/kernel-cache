Subject: [PATCH 128/347] mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: prepare *set_timing() to be
 used for iodelay setting

This patch comes from:
  git://git.ti.com/processor-sdk/processor-sdk-linux.git

No functional change. Add separate case statements for certain timing
like MMC_TIMING_SD_HS and MMC_TIMING_MMC_HS even though AC12_UHSMC_RES
has to be written to the AC12 register (same as for default modes).
Also have separate case sections for MMC_TIMING_UHS_SDR104 and
MMC_TIMING_UHS_HS200 even though the same UHSMC value has to be written
to the AC12 register. This is in preparation for setting iodelay
values.
