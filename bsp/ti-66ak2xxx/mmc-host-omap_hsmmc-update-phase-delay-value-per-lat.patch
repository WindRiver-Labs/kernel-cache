Subject: [PATCH 148/347] mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: update phase delay value per
 latest TRM
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

This patch comes from:
  git://git.ti.com/processor-sdk/processor-sdk-linux.git

While performing tuning, known data pattern is sent and received
with different phase delay values and the centered DLL ratio
of the largest passing window is selected as the final DLL ratio.
However The 3/4th DLL ratio value of the largest passing window
has better reliability and is more stable. So use the
3/4th DLL ratio value instead of the centered DLL ratio suggested
in earlier TRMs.

Newer TRMs have been updated to reflect this.
