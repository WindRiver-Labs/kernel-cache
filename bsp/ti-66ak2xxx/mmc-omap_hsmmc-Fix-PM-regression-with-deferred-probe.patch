Subject: [PATCH 150/347] mmc: omap_hsmmc: Fix PM regression with deferred
 probe for pm_runtime_reinit

This patch comes from:
  git://git.ti.com/processor-sdk/processor-sdk-linux.git

commit 814a3c0c2a8dfad97089f6bdc71b374f6076490e upstream

Commit 5de85b9d57ab ("PM / runtime: Re-init runtime PM states at probe
error and driver unbind") introduced pm_runtime_reinit() that is used
to reinitialize PM runtime after -EPROBE_DEFER. This allows shutting
down the device after a failed probe.

However, for drivers using pm_runtime_use_autosuspend() this can cause
a state where suspend callback is never called after -EPROBE_DEFER.
On the following device driver probe, hardware state is different from
the PM runtime state causing omap_device to produce the following
error:

omap_device_enable() called from invalid state 1

And with omap_device and omap hardware being picky for PM, this will
block any deeper idle states in hardware.

The solution is to fix the drivers to follow the PM runtime documentation:

1. For sections of code that needs the device disabled, use
   pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend() if pm_runtime_set_autosuspend() has
   been set.

2. For driver exit code, use pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() before
   pm_runtime_put_sync() if pm_runtime_use_autosuspend() has been
   set.

error and driver unbind")
