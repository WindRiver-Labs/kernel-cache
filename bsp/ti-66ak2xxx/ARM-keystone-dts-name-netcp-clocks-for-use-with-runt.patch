Subject: [PATCH 025/347] ARM: keystone: dts: name netcp clocks for use with
 runtime_pm

This patch comes from:
  git://git.ti.com/processor-sdk/processor-sdk-linux.git

Netcp driver uses runtime_pm api in probe() and requires clocks to be
named so that it gets enabled. While at it, fix the pa clock to
point to the clkpa which has clock rate of 1/3 of PA PLL clock and add
osr (On Chip Standalone RAM)_clk for K2L as osr is used as external
link ram.
