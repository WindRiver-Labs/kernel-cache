Subject: [PATCH 320/347] ARM: dts: keystone: k2e/l/g: enable cpts ts_comp

This patch comes from:
  git://git.ti.com/processor-sdk/processor-sdk-linux.git

CPTS module of 1G Ethernet (GbE) Switch Subsystem on Keystone SoCs
66AK2Exx/66AK2Lxx/66AK2Gxx supports time stamp comparison event and TS_COMP
signal output generation when CPTS counter reaches a value written to the
TS_COMP_VAL register.

Hence, enable corresponding feature in DT.
