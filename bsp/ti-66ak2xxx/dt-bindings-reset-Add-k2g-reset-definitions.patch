Subject: [PATCH 021/347] dt-bindings: reset: Add k2g reset definitions

This patch comes from:
  git://git.ti.com/processor-sdk/processor-sdk-linux.git

Add identifiers for the reset values to be used by reset
consumer device nodes (like a DSP) on the Keystone 2
Galileo (K2G) SoC. The values are used to define the
resets required by the devices, and are defined in
conformance with those used on the Power Management
Micro Controller (PMMC) firmware.
