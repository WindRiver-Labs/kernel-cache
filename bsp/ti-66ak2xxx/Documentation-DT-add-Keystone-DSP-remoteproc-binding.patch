+TI Keystone DSP devices
+=======================
+
+Binding status: Unstable - Subject to changes for using common shared memories
+
+The TI Keystone 2 family of SoCs usually have one or more (upto 8) TI DSP Core
+sub-systems that are used to offload some of the processor-intensive tasks or
+algorithms, for achieving various system level goals.
+
+The processor cores in the sub-system usually contain additional sub-modules
+like L1 and/or L2 caches/SRAMs, an Interrupt Controller, an external memory
+controller, a dedicated local power/sleep controller etc. The DSP processor
+core in Keystone 2 SoCs is usually a TMS320C66x CorePac processor.
+
+DSP Device Node:
+================
+Each DSP Core sub-system is represented as a single DT node. Each node has a
+number of required or optional properties that enable the OS running on the
+host processor (ARM CorePac) to perform the device management of the remote
+processor and to communicate with the remote processor.
+
+Required properties:
+--------------------
+The following are the mandatory properties:
+
+- compatible:		Should be one of the following,
+			    "ti,k2hk-dsp" for DSPs on Keystone2 Hawking/Kepler SoCs
+			    "ti,k2l-dsp" for DSPs on Keystone2 Lamarr SoCs
+			    "ti,k2e-dsp" for DSPs on Keystone2 Edison SoCs
+			    "ti,k2g-dsp" for DSPs on Keystone2 Galileo SoCs
+
+- reg:			Should contain an entry for each value in 'reg-names'.
+			Each entry should have the memory region's start address
+			and the size of the region, the representation matching
+			the parent node's '#address-cells' and '#size-cells' values.
+
+- reg-names:		Should contain strings with the following names, each
+			representing a specific internal memory region, and
+			should be defined in this order,
+			     "l2sram", "l1pram", "l1dram"
+
+- clocks: 		Should contain the device's input clock, and should be
+			defined as per the bindings in,
+			Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/keystone-gate.txt
+			    for K2HK/K2L/K2E SoCs or,
+			Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/ti,sci-clk.txt
+			    for K2G SoC
+
+- ti,syscon-dev:	Should be a pair of the phandle to the Keystone Device
+			State Control node, and the register offset of the DSP
+			boot address register within that node's address space.
+
+- resets:		Should contain the phandle to the reset controller node
+			managing the resets for this device, and a reset
+			specifier. Please refer to either of the following reset
+			bindings for the reset argument specifier as per SoC,
+			Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset/syscon-reset.txt
+			    for K2HK/K2L/K2E SoCs or,
+			Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset/ti,sci-reset.txt
+			    for K2G SoC
+
+- interrupt-parent:	Should contain a phandle to the Keystone 2 IRQ controller
+			IP node that is used by the ARM CorePac processor to
+			receive interrupts from the DSP remote processors. See
+			Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/ti,keystone-irq.txt
+			for details.
+
+- interrupts: 		Should contain an entry for each value in 'interrupt-names'.
+			Each entry should have the interrupt source number used by
+			the remote processor to the host processor. The values should
+			follow the interrupt-specifier format as dictated by the
+			'interrupt-parent' node. The purpose of each is as per the
+			description in the 'interrupt-names' property.
+
+- interrupt-names:	Should contain strings with the following names, each
+			representing a specific interrupt,
+			    "vring" - interrupt for virtio based IPC
+			    "exception" - interrupt for exception notification
+
+- kick-gpio: 		Should specify the gpio device needed for the virtio IPC
+			stack. This will be used to interrupt the remote processor,
+			and should be defined as per the bindings in,
+			Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt
+
+Optional properties:
+--------------------
+
+- power-domains:	_required_ property only for Keystone 2 Galileo SoC.
+			Should contain a phandle to a PM domain provider node,
+			and a PM domain specifier as defined by the binding,
+			Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/ti/sci-pm-domain.txt
+
+- memory-region:	phandle to the reserved memory node to be associated
+			with the remoteproc device. The reserved memory node
+			can be a CMA memory node, and should be defined as
+			per the bindings in
+			Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt
+
+
+Examples:
+---------
+
+1.
