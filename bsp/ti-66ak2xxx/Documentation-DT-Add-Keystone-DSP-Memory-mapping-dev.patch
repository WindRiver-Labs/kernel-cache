Subject: [PATCH 212/347] Documentation: DT: Add Keystone DSP Memory mapping
 device binding

This patch comes from:
  git://git.ti.com/processor-sdk/processor-sdk-linux.git

Add the device tree binding document for the userspace memory mapping
driver on Keystone SoCs.

The binding status is unstable, as this might be redone completely
to accomplish this in a saner fashion.

+TI Keystone DSP Memory Mapping Device
+=====================================
+
+Binding status: Unstable - ABI compatibility may be broken in the future
+
+The Keystone DSP Memory Mapping Device is a device node used to represent
+the memory regions that can be mapped into userspace for providing direct
+user-mode access to regions for the purposes of shared memory communication
+with the DSP remote processor devices on the SoC. It can also be used for
+supporting user-space based loading of the DSP remoteproc devices.
+
+Required properties:
+--------------------
+- compatible : Should be "ti,keystone-dsp-mem"
+- reg        : An array of memory regions, each region represented by a tuple
+               of the region's start address and the size of the region.
+
+Example:
+--------
+	/* K2HK EVM */
+	soc {
+		mpm_mem: dspmem {
+			compatible = "ti,keystone-dsp-mem";
+			reg  = <0x0c000000 0x00600000>, /* MSMC Memory */
+			       <0xa0000000 0x20000000>; /* DDR Memory */
+		};
+	};
