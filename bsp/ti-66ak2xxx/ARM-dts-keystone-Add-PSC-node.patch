Subject: [PATCH 075/347] ARM: dts: keystone: Add PSC node

This patch comes from:
  git://git.ti.com/processor-sdk/processor-sdk-linux.git

The Power Sleep Controller (PSC) module is responsible
for the power and clock management for each of the peripherals
present on the SoC. Represent this as a syscon node so that
multiple users can leverage it for various functionalities.
