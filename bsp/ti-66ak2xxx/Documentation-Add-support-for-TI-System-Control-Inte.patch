Subject: [PATCH 009/347] Documentation: Add support for TI System Control
 Interface (TI-SCI) protocol

This patch comes from:
  git://git.ti.com/processor-sdk/processor-sdk-linux.git

Texas Instrument's System Control Interface (TI-SCI) Message Protocol
is used in Texas Instrument's System on Chip (SoC) such as those
in newer SoCs in the keystone processor family starting with K2G.
This message protocol is used to communicate between various compute
entities (such as processors like ARM, DSP etc.) with a central system
controller entity.

TI-SCI message protocol provides support for management of various
hardware entitites within the SoC.

The message protocol can be found here: TBD.

+Texas Instruments System Control Interface (TI-SCI) Message Protocol
+-------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+Texas Instrument's processors including those belonging to Keystone generation
+of processors have separate hardware entity which is now responsible for the
+management of the System on Chip (SoC) system. These include various system
+level functions as well.
+
+TI-SCI controller Device Node:
+=============================
+
+Required properties:
+--------------------
+- compatible: should be "ti,k2g-sci"
+- mbox-names:
+	"rx" - Mailbox corresponding to receive path
+	"tx" - Mailbox corresponding to transmit path
+
+- mboxes: Mailboxes corresponding to the mbox-names. Each value of the mboxes
+	  property should contain a phandle to the mailbox controller device
+	  node and an args specifier that will be the phandle to the intended
+	  sub-mailbox child node to be used for communication.
+
+See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/mailbox.txt for more details
+about the generic mailbox controller and client driver bindings. Also see
+Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/ti,message-manager.txt for typical
+controller that is used to communicate with this System controllers.
+
+Optional Properties:
+--------------------
+- reg-names:
+	debug_messages - Map the Debug message region
+- reg:  register space corresponding to the debug_messages
+
+Example (K2G):
+--------
+	pmmc: pmmc {
+		compatible = "ti,k2g-sci";
+		mbox-names = "rx", "tx";
+		mboxes= <&msgmgr &msgmgr_proxy_pmmc_rx>,
+			<&msgmgr &msgmgr_proxy_pmmc_tx>;
+		reg-names = "debug_messages";
+		reg = <0x02921800 0x800>;
+	};
+
+
+TI-SCI Client Device Node:
+========================
+
+Client nodes refer to the required TI-SCI device using the "ti,sci" property.
+
+Example (K2G):
+-------------
+	my_dev_node: dev_node {
+		...
+		ti,sci = <&pmmc>;
+		...
+	}
