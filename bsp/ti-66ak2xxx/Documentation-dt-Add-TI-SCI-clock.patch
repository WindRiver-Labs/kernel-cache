Subject: [PATCH 016/347] Documentation: dt: Add TI SCI clock

This patch comes from:
  git://git.ti.com/processor-sdk/processor-sdk-linux.git

Add a clock implementation, TI SCI clock, that will hook to the common
clock framework, and allow each clock to be controlled via TI SCI protocol.

+Texas Instruments TI-SCI Clocks
+
+All clocks on Texas Instruments' SoCs that contain a System Controller
+core, are only controlled by this entity. Communication between a
+host processor running an OS and the System Controller happens through a
+protocol known as TI SCI. This clock implementation plugs into the
+common clock framework and makes use of the TI SCI protocol on clock
+API requests.
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible: Must be "ti,sci-clk"
+- #clock-cells: Shall be 2.
+  In clock consumers, this cell represents the device ID and clock ID
+  exposed by the PM firmware. The assignments can be found in the header
+  files <dt-bindings/genpd/<soc>.h> (which covers the device IDs) and
+  <dt-bindings/clock/<soc>.h> (which covers the clock IDs), where <soc>
+  is the SoC involved, for example 'k2g'.
+- ti,sci: Phandle to the TI SCI device to use for managing the clocks
+
+Optional properties:
+- ti,ssc-clocks: Array of phandle clocks that shall enable spread spectrum
+		 clocking while enabled
+- ti,allow-freq-change-clocks: Array of phandle clocks that shall allow
+			       dynamic clock frequency changes by firmware
+- ti,input-term-clocks: Array of phandle clocks that shall enable input
+			termination
+
+Examples:
+
+k2g_clks: k2g_clks {
+	compatible = "ti,sci-clk";
+	ti,sci = <&pmmc>;
+	#clock-cells = <2>;
+};
+
+dummy_node@1234 {
+	clocks = <&k2g_clks K2G_DEV_DUMMY K2G_DEV_DUMMY_FCK>;
+};
+
+dummy_node2@2345 {
+	clocks = <&k2g_clks K2G_DEV_DUMMY2 K2G_DEV_DUMMY_X1_CLK>;
+};
+
+&k2g_clks {
+	ti,ssc-clocks = <&k2g_clks K2G_DEV_DUMMY K2G_DEV_DUMMY_FCK>;
+};
